2. Next, click on **Create Link**.

3. Set a private note. For protection options, choose **Direct only visible to accounts you add**.

4. Set the necessary permissions and then create the **Generate Link**.

5. To the right of the newly created **Share link**, click on the **Add Users** icon.

6. Search for the user you wish to grant access to the sharing tool.

7. Check the box next to the user's name and then click on the **Update Access** button.

The user will then gain access to this **Share**. You can verify this by navigating to that user's account and clicking on **Share it with Me**.
