Lens follows a straightforward model where a user creates an organization, adds new members, then creates workspaces, and adds members of the parent organization to workspaces.

Thus, in the project hierarchy, the user who created the organization is automatically assigned the role of the organization owner, is given admin priveleges, and has the power to manage the organization and its workspaces.
