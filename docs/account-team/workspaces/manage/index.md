Inside a workspace, you can organize files into directories. To do so, click **Create Directory**, name the directory in a newly opened dialog and press Enter or click **Create** to confirm directory creation. Single-click the directory and then click **Add New File** to upload a file. All file types are supported, but mesh will be generated only for FCStd, STEP, and OBJ files.

To delete a file, click it to open, then click the **Delete File** button above the preview area.

To delete a directory, click it to open, then click the **Delete Directory** button above.

Neither single deleted files, nor entire directories along with all files inside them can be recovered!
