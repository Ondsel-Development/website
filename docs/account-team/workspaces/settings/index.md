Settings of a workspaces can be accessed in two ways:

- **From the list of workspaces** available in an organization, click the gear icon to the right of the workspaces's name.
- **Inside a workspace**, click the the gear icon to the right of the workspaces's name at the top.

There are three parts of workspace settings: general settings, access control for single users, access control for groups.

General settings:

- **Name**. This is the displayed name of the workspace. To change the name of the workspace, click **Change Name**, submit new name, then click **Change** to confirm.
<!-- - **Slug**. This is the publicly-visible part of the workspace's URL. Once it has been created, it cannot be changed. -->
- **Open to Public View**. This setting controls visibility of files in the workspace. For _Peer_ and _Enterprise_ tiers, all workspaces default to 'false', so all files are not publicly visible or accessible by default. Click **Change Visibility** to change this setting, select the other option, then click **Change** to confirm.
- **Share License (if any)**. This allows setting a license to files in the entire workspaces, both existing and future ones. Lens defaults to not specifying a license, which means other users will have to contact the owner for clarification. Alternatively, as a workspace administrator you can choose of Creative Commons licenses or assign "All Rights reserved". To do so, click **Change License**, select a different option, then click **Change** to confirm.
- **Short description**. This is the displayed description of the workspaces. To change the description of the workspace, click **Change Description**, submit new description, then click **Change** to confirm.
- **Long Description**. This is a longer description of the workspace displayed when you open its root folder. If there is a `README.md` file in the workspace, Lens will render it, and the settings page will show the beginning of that document.
- **Tags**. You can add some tags to increase your workspace's discoverability through search. To do so, click on **Edit Tags**, then add tags and click on **Save**.
