Ondsel is an all-remote company. We employ people living in the U.S., the EU, and India. Multiple independent contractors are based in the U.S., Latin America, and Eastern Europe.

When recruiting, we are primarily looking at the expertise that a potential employee or contractor could bring to the table. Hands-on experience with FreeCAD and hacking on its source code is a great bonus, but not a necessity. We also greatly value soft skills.
