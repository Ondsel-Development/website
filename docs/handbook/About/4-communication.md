## Blog content release plan

The [Ondsel blog](/blog) is the primary place where we publish our vision, plans, ideas, and questions for the community.  After publishing, we try to be strategic with sharing our content via social media.  For general content, we publish in the following places.  Posts should be published where it makes the most sense.  Our intent is to be helpful and constructive with our content, not just spamming every available outlet.

### Reddit
 /r/freecad subreddit has an active and engaged base of FreeCAD users.  We often get good engagement and constructive feedback.  Content here should be strictly FreeCAD related, not general Ondsel information.

### Facebook

Facebook has several FreeCAD related communities.  All blog posts should be published on the Ondsel page.  Share those posts to groups as it makes sense.  Two groups of note are the main FreeCAD group and the FreeCAD Power Users group.


### Twitter

Share all blog posts from the [@ondsel](https://twitter.com/ondsel) account

### FreeCAD Forum

FreeCAD related content can be shared on the FreeCAD forum. Posts should be made in the most appropriate forum section.  For general FreeCAD related content, The [open discussion](https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=8) section is probably the most appropriate

### LinkedIn
All posts can be made to the [Ondsel](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ondsel/) page.  FreeCAD related content can be posted/shared to [FreeCAD Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4295230/) There is also a page for the FreeCAD Project Association.  Only FPA relevatant content should be posted/shared here.
