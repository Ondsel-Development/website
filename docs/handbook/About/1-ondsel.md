# About us

Ondsel is an open-core company founded by Brad Collette together with Open Core Ventures.
Ondsel builds on top of the venerable FreeCAD solid modeling tool to bring commercial features that make FreeCAD more useful to commercial users.


## What does our name mean?

Ondsel is a sound-alike word for the dutch word _rondsel_ which means 'cog' or 'pinion'.
A pinion gear is a small but critical gear that engages with a larger gear to get work done.

Ondsel is one part of the larger FreeCAD ecosystem.  We want to be one part of your design toolkit too.
