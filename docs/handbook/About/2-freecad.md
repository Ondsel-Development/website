## What's FreeCAD?
Originally [started](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/History) as a parametric 3D Computer-aided Design (CAD) modeling tool, FreeCAD has grown to include many other capabilities like:
- Building Information Modeling (BIM)
- Finite Element Method(FEM)
- Computer Aided Machining (CAM)

FreeCAD uses open-source libraries for much of it's functionality.  Notable
-Open CASCADE Technology is the CAD kernel
- Coin3D for the scenegraph
- Qt for the GUI framework
- Python for much of the user-facing logic and UI automation as well as FreeCAD's macro system

FreeCAD has a healthy community with many contributors and many 3D party workbenches that extend the core functionality into many other areas.

## What's the FreeCAD Project Association?
