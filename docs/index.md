This documentation covers Ondsel Engineering Suite (ES) and Ondsel Lens PDM
service.

As Ondsel ES is built largely on top of FreeCAD, the suite documentation is
currently comprised mostly of embedded videos and links to existing FreeCAD
docs. 

This documentation will guide you through various topics:

- Designing parametric 3D CAD models with constraints and custom properties
- Performing finite element analysis to find design flaws
- Building kinematic assemblies, making exploded views, and generating bills of materials
- Generating 2D documentation from 3D views 
- Collaborating on design projects: sharing models, versioning, managing organizations
