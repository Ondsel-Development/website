You can upload FCStd (FreeCAD) and OBJ files to Ondsel Lens.

## Uploading from a browser

To upload a file to a workspace in Lens,

1. Log into your Lens account.
2. Click to select a workspace in the 'Personal' organization, or select a different organization first.
3. Click to select the directory where the file should be located.
4. Click the 'ADD NEW FILE' button.
5. Click 'BROWSE' and point the browser to the file that you want to upload, or drop the file from a file manager into the drag-and-drop area.

Lens will generate mesh from the file and list the newly added file among available files in the directory of choice.

## Uploading from Ondsel ES

To upload a file to a workspace in Lens,

1. Open a file in Ondsel ES.
2. Log into your Lens account.
3. Click to select a workspace and then a directory.
4. Click 'Add' and in the drop-down list select 'Add current file'. This will prompt you to save the currently opened file to a local directory with cached files.

Ondsel ES will submit the file to the workspace and directory of choice on your Lens account and mark the file as synced.
