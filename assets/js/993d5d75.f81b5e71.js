Models are built up progressively with later features depending on the geometry from earlier steps. If the user goes back to an earlier step and changes it, later steps can break because the base feature they depend on changes. To avoid that, the CAD software needs to keep track of all geometry features you create and provide a way to recover when a certain geometry feature is taken from under another one.
