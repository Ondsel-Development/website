Pray I do not alter it further.\u2019\\n>>\\t\u2014 Darth Vader\\n>\\n>If that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to treat the hobbyists, then goodbye forever to Fusion 360.\u201d\\n>\u2014 [solarguy2003](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/blog/changes-to-fusion-360-for-personal-use/#comment-11741)\\n\\nOver two years ago [Autodesk imposed a number of new limitations on its free non-commercial-use license for Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/blog/changes-to-fusion-360-for-personal-use/), primarily impacting hobbyist and casual users: project storage was limited, exports to a number of (critical) file types were no longer offered, and support for CAM was drastically cut back, among other restrictions. These changes felt like a slap in the face, with some members deleting their Fusion 360 accounts in protest (whether or not they were affected by the new limitations).\\n\\n### The proprietary bait and switch\\nThe changes to the license for Fusion 360 for Personal Use were a perfect illustration of the risk of making use of \u201cfree as in beer\u201d software. Many users felt betrayed and frustrated at the new limitations:\\n\\n> \u201cThe file export limitations in particular are crippling. No .step? .dxf? No extensions??? I can\'t even buy stress simulation credits? \u2026 yikes.\u201d\\n> \u2014 [raynr on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24496171)\\n\\nSome users were not surprised, saying it was inevitable that the company would seek to monetize more of their product, even suggesting that the Fusion 360 license had been overly generous to begin with. This take undermines the exchange of benefits that takes place between vendors of free software and the communities that spring up around it:\\n\\n\u201cThink of the tens of millions of man-hours that have been invested into forum posts helping users, developing plugins, courses, YouTube videos, and Makerspace workshops that could have instead gone into making open source tools like KiCAD, OpenSCAD, pycam, etc better.\\n\\n>\\"All that work done by hobbyists, for free, helping Autodesk dominate the market in low-end CAD/CAM software.\u201d\\n>\u2014 [sfdsfsdfdsf on Hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/2020/09/16/autodesk-announces-major-changes-to-fusion-360-personal-use-license-terms/#comment-6278789)\\n\\nWhile Autodesk maintained they were still committed to \u201cdemocratizing design for everyone,\u201d the community didn\u2019t buy it, seeing it as a bid to squeeze money out of hobbyist users after riding their coattails to market domination. As one disappointed user commented:\\n\\n\u201c... you showed that you prefer to spend money to block existing features of your software instead of improving it with new paid features. That\u2019s an indicator that you don\u2019t care about the product itself anymore, but that you are just trying to extract the maximum money out of your current users instead.\u201d\u2014 [streakycobra on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24498013)\\n\\n### So where did disgruntled Fusion users go?\\nFusion users asked, \u201cWhat can we use instead?\u201d and the overwhelming sentiment was in favor of supporting free and open source projects that can\u2019t be bought out or taken away.\\n\\nAs a longtime contributor to FreeCAD I was happy to see it suggested often. The effect can be seen clearly in FreeCAD\u2019s [GitHub star history](https://star-history.com/#freecad/freecad&Date): the count has more than tripled since September 2020.\\n\\n![github star history](./image3.png)\\n\\nCaption: You can see a dramatic 30% star growth after Autodesk\u2019s controversial changes\\n\\nThe spike in followers for [@FreeCADNews](https://twitter.com/freecadnews) tells a story too:\\n\\n![twitter analytics](./image1.png)\\n\\n\\nAnd here\u2019s the project\u2019s [growth in contributions](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/graphs/contributors):\\n\\n![contribution growth](./image2.png)\\n\\nIn the 2+ years since Autodesk changed the Fusion 360 license, new communities around FreeCAD have sprung up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4295230/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCAD/), and [Facebook](https://facebook.com/FreeCAD/)\u2014all with over 3,000 members.\\n\\nWe know that one of the tradeoffs with FOSS is that sometimes you might need to roll up your sleeves and contribute (time or money) towards the features and fixes you want to see. It\u2019s gratifying to see this growing community getting involved to continue developing FreeCAD into a viable Fusion alternative, without the bait-and-switch risk of proprietary solutions.\\n\\n### Where to from here?\\nI\u2019m now working full time on Ondsel, built on top of FreeCAD. While Ondsel\u2019s product set is still being defined, my vision is to improve on the FreeCAD UI to make it more accessible for non-software engineers and build the collaborative features that small businesses and enterprises can benefit from\u2014now with the resources of full-time development talent. With open core, the business model is to [monetize features based on who will use them](https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-01-open-core-standard-pricing-model/), with the core product remaining free and open to all. A strong core is integral to Ondsel\u2019s success, as the core features are often an onramp for casual or hobby users who grow into businesses of their own and require different features as they scale. Having a solid and active open source ecosystem around it is vital to actually democratizing design for everyone. In the coming months I\u2019ll be hiring engineers to help define this vision and build it with me, but in the meantime I [would love to hear from you](https://github.com/orgs/Ondsel-Development/discussions/1) about what you\u2019d like to see from FreeCAD and Ondsel in the future.\\n\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Note...</summary>\\n  <div>\\n    <div>I\u2019m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.

That was an important milestone \u2026 and it passed with hardly anyone noticing. There was another important development last year and it barely got any more attention, even though it was far more consequential.\\n\\nI\'m referring to the creation of the FPA: FreeCAD Project Association. The FPA is a legal entity whose mission is to advance and protect the FreeCAD project. Besides being able to receive donations and pay for services, the FPA has a formal membership and decision making structure and this matters.\\n\\n## FreeCAD is changing\\nFor many years the FreeCAD project operated as a loose confederacy of core developers.  Decisions were made by consensus. Development moved forward when someone had an itch to scratch and the project philosophy was, \\"It\'s done when it\'s done.\\" That kind of loose government served the project pretty well. Until it didn\'t.\\n\\nAs the number of developers grew and the codebase got larger, consensus was harder to reach. Some problems defied consensus altogether. Too often, it felt like nobody was steering the ship. Many people wanted to see a clearer roadmap. They wanted leadership to address those thorny issues. Without a roadmap it was too risky for commercial companies to build around FreeCAD. Without leadership, there was no confidence that big problems would be addressed and industrial users were unwilling to adopt FreeCAD for mission-critical use.\\n\\n## Introducing the FPA\\nThe FPA was launched with modest goals. The founders wanted to avoid a heavy-handed dictatorial style. They want to encourage the kind of collaboration and consensus that has made the project productive and fun for two decades. They also recognized that FreeCAD is maturing as a project and some formal structure is necessary. I was honored to be part of that process and deeply impressed with the wisdom and care that the founders took to balance these interests.\\n\\nWhile the FPA is still finding its footing, it has already started taking steps that should have everyone excited.\\n\\nFirst, the FPA has money and the willingness to fund development. With it, they can encourage focused effort in areas where organic interest hasn\'t emerged.\\n\\nEven more importantly, the FPA is working to get developers together in the same room. Zoom, email, and issue trackers are the tools we live with and they work well for day-to-day operations. But there\'s nothing like face-to-face meetings for building trust, resolving conflict, and making long term plans. The ability to work face-to-face is one area where commercial development has a clear advantage over open source software. The FPA recognizes this and is taking steps to change it.\\n\\n## FreeCAD Day at FOSDEM\\nThe first ever \'[FreeCAD Day](https://blog.freecad.org/2023/01/04/freecad-meeting-day-2023/)\' will be held prior to FOSDEM on February 2, 2023. The day will be organized as an _unconference_. People attending the event will propose and decide what to do on premises. There will be plenty of opportunities for side discussions.\\n\\nFOSDEM brings together developers from hundreds of open source projects. It provides a fantastic opportunity to discuss collaboration opportunities with other projects, learn from their successes and from their mistakes, and meet like-minded folks.\\n\\n## Ondsel in the room\\nThe dream of building a commercial company around FreeCAD has been around for a long time. It\'s one way that developers could build not just a world-class CAD solution but their own careers. Now that Ondsel is finally launched as an open core company we are excited to partner with the FPA and the FreeCAD community at FreeCAD Day 1.0. We look forward to meeting, collaborating, dreaming, and building great things together."},{"id":"hello-world","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/hello-world","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-01-03-Hello-world.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-03-Hello-world.md","title":"Hello world!","description":"Ondsel is Launched!","date":"2023-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 3, 2023","tags":[{"label":"hola","permalink":"/blog/tags/hola"},{"label":"opencoreventures","permalink":"/blog/tags/opencoreventures"},{"label":"news","permalink":"/blog/tags/news"}],"readingTime":0.585,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Brad Collette","title":"Ondsel Core Team","url":"https://github.com/sliptonic","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"hello-world","title":"Hello world!","authors":{"name":"Brad Collette","title":"Ondsel Core Team","url":"https://github.com/sliptonic","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4"},"tags":["hola","opencoreventures","news"],"image":"/img/Ondsel_OpenGraph.jpg"},"prevItem":{"title":"It\u2019s Time to Dream Big \u2026 and Build: The future of FreeCAD + the first ever FreeCAD Day at FOSDEM","permalink":"/blog/dream-big"}},"content":"Ondsel is Launched!\\n\\nTechnically, we started life at the beginning of January 2023.
