Ondsel is an open-core company. Our business model is providing added value on top of what FreeCAD already offers. That includes:

- **Our own distribution of FreeCAD** with more polish and direct access to the latest improvements and new features created by Ondsel. We submit our changes to upstream FreeCAD so that users of the upstream project could benefit from those as well.
- **Ondsel Lens**, an online service for storing, sharing, exploring, and customizing designs primarily made with FreeCAD. Lens is integrated into our own distribution of FreeCAD and is available to users of upstream FreeCAD software via the addon manager.

We stick with the tried-and-true pricing model that has a free tier for everyone, a paid tier for single users, and an enterprise tier for companies with multiple seats.
