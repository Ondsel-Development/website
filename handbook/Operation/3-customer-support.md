## Where we collect bug reports and feature requests

We currently prioritize GitHub issues over other communication channels to
receive bug reports and feature requests. Filing issues and requests is
possible for the three public Git repositories:

- The [Ondsel Lens add-on](https://github.com/Ondsel-Development/Ondsel-Lens)
for FreeCAD
- Ondsel's [distrubution of FreeCAD](https://github.com/Ondsel-Development/FreeCAD)
- Ondsel's [kinematic solver](https://github.com/Ondsel-Development/OndselSolver)
developed for FreeCAD's integrated assembly workbench

Reports against the Ondsel Lens service can be submitted on our official
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/7jmzezyyfP), either in the #feedback 
or in the #lens channels.

We will also do our best to respond to requests about our products on social
media channels. We are present and active here:

- [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/ondsel)
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ondsel)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ondsel/)

## How we handle reports and requests

Reports and requests on the Lens add-on, the distribution of FreeCAD, and the
kinematic solver are handled the usual way: we assign a developer, try to reproduce
and then fix the reported issue.

Reports and requests for the Lens platform are currently coming mostly through
chats on the Discord server or privately. We file those as issues on GitHub and
additionally manage those via a different project management system to manage 
internal releases.
