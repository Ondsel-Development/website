Dr du Plessis introduced FreeCAD to his second-year curriculum back in 2020.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-is-proprietary-cad-software-the-default-at-universities">Why is proprietary CAD software the default at universities?<a href="#why-is-proprietary-cad-software-the-default-at-universities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why is proprietary CAD software the default at universities?" title="Direct link to Why is proprietary CAD software the default at universities?">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>“Corporations offer ‘student’ and ‘community’ licenses because they hope that these will lead to users getting jobs where they will ask their employers to purchase these tools. They do not do this because they want to nurture the hobbyists or craftspeople.” – <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/09/16/autodesk-announces-major-changes-to-fusion0-personal-use-license-terms/#comment-6279614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrightBlueJim on Hackaday.com</a></p></blockquote><p>It’s not an act of charity or goodwill for vendors to make their software free to use for educational purposes: the entrenchment of tools like SOLIDWORKS and Fusion 360 at these institutions is a key part of their pipeline as students graduate, enter the workforce, and advocate to use familiar tools at work.</p><p>These tools then become entrenched in workplaces, making it difficult for graduates to onboard if they don’t know how to use the software already:</p><blockquote><p>“Not choosing Autodesk is a career ending mistake in many cases, too.” –  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24505752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emteycz on Hacker News</a></p></blockquote><p>This is fine for students joining a big firm with plenty of budget for their seat. But good luck to graduates who want to start their own businesses and suddenly can’t afford the license.</p><p>This pattern is hard to shift, as educators can (understandably) be resistant to the burden of learning and then teaching a new tool. It’s tricky to coordinate across a department and align on what software is being used and taught in different years and modules. Even where educators are willing to bring in free alternatives (like FreeCAD), their lack of polish can be off putting to students.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="your-students-deserve-better">Your students deserve better<a href="#your-students-deserve-better" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Your students deserve better" title="Direct link to Your students deserve better">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>“F360 is probably the easiest to learn, but... I strongly recommend also learning FreeCAD so you have a backup plan if you aren’t made of money.” –  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fusion360/comments/r88l8x/is_fusion360_hard_to_learn/hn6k5b3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LightStormPilot on r/Fusion360</a></p></blockquote><p>As educators, your students are your customers. Your responsibility is to set them up for success by teaching them design principles, not one specific tool. Including exposure to open source solutions in curricula gives students a number of benefits:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="flexibility">Flexibility<a href="#flexibility" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Flexibility" title="Direct link to Flexibility">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>“It’s like a teacher teaching students to write a letter. The emphasis should be on the communication and writing skills—not on the tool. The teacher can’t teach the students to use Microsoft Word in order for them to write the letter.” – Dr Lukas du Plessis, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Pretoria</p></blockquote><p>Of course, it is important to introduce students to industry-standard, commercial software so that  they’re prepared for the workforce, but it’s a disservice not to at least expose them to the alternatives. Students who go into industry will be working in environments with mixed software, and educators should anticipate and include interoperability in the curriculum. They should be skeptical of software provided by corporations that doesn’t support data portability.</p><p>Students should at least understand that the choice of which software they use has long-term implications:</p><ul><li>Will they be able to switch to something else later if it becomes too expensive or no longer serves their needs?</li><li>Will it work on their own computer when they don’t have access to their current setup?</li></ul><p>Open source software unlocks far greater flexibility and customization for different use cases: for example, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxHr9sYNRUo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guitar workbench</a> presented at the <a href="https://www.up.ac.za/mechanical-and-aeronautical-engineering/article/3136162/freecad-users-conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD User Conference</a> earlier this year. “There’s no commercial package that will develop such a workbench, it’s far too niche,” says Dr du Plessis.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="performance">Performance<a href="#performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Performance" title="Direct link to Performance">​</a></h3><p>This aspect of the open source vs proprietary conversation doesn’t always get a lot of airtime, but it’s especially pertinent for educational institutions: commercial CAD software is often extremely hard wearing and resource intensive, and requires bleeding-edge hardware to perform at its best. Educational institutions rarely have access to the kind of hardware needed to make the software run effectively.</p><p>FreeCAD however is better suited for this environment, according to Dr du Plessis: “I introduced FreeCAD at the University of Pretoria and it’s not very hardware intensive—we’ve had no issues in the computer labs.”</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="institutions-can-be-the-change">Institutions can be the change<a href="#institutions-can-be-the-change" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Institutions can be the change" title="Direct link to Institutions can be the change">​</a></h2><p>It’s encouraging to see some educators taking initiative to change the course. Dr du Plessis, as mentioned above, has been advocating for students to get exposure to and learn FreeCAD at the University of Pretoria.</p><p>The university historically has taught SOLIDWORKS to students from their first year. As he started learning FreeCAD himself, Dr du Plessis has been introducing FreeCAD to his second-year students since 2020. “It doesn’t make sense to have access to free software, but then only afterwards the students need to start paying for exorbitant licenses.”</p><p>In 2019, Dr du Plessis received funding from the UK’s <a href="https://africaprize.raeng.org.uk/about-the-prize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royal Academy of Engineering</a> to develop a separate workbench inside FreeCAD. One of the deliverables was to introduce FreeCAD in the university’s undergraduate program, which helped give credibility to the initiative.</p><p>“I make students very much aware of the fact that commercial packages come at a premium,” says Dr du Plessis. “I also push hard for them to understand that there is a free version. Yes, it’s not as refined, but it’s good enough for 95% of what they want to do.”</p><p>Dr du Plessis also has a vision for what he calls FreeCAD Free Labs to make FreeCAD more accessible to more makers.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-educators-and-students-can-do">What educators and students can do<a href="#what-educators-and-students-can-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What educators and students can do" title="Direct link to What educators and students can do">​</a></h2><p>Yes, there is a burden to learning new technology and then teaching it to your students, but there are a lot of free resources out there that you can point students to. You can lean on educational creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FreeCADAcademy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Academy on YouTube</a> and the <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD community</a> so you can focus on teaching design principles.</p><p>To any students reading this, it’s also up to you to take responsibility for your own education. Be wary of any educator that requires a particular tool rather than teaching you the principles of use that can be generalized. You don’t need permission to explore alternative tools.</p><p>The <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Project Association</a> is interested in broadening the use of FreeCAD in education. They’ve set up a brief survey to gather feedback and start building a network of interested people. They’d love to hear from folks in academia but also non-traditional educators making YouTube content or paid courses.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="take-the-survey"><em><a href="https://forms.gle/zXZFP5yf2ZwrnPbN7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Take The Survey</a></em><a href="#take-the-survey" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to take-the-survey" title="Direct link to take-the-survey">​</a></h2></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad/">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/education/">education</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/autodesk/">autodesk</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/lock-in/">lock-in</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-1d3d1fb4e1ecd51ef6e1c30d218d1bf4.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/how-to-build-3rd-party-addons-for-freecad-that-don’t-suck/">How to build 3rd-party addons for FreeCAD that don’t suck</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-10-13T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">October 13, 2023</time> · <!-- -->8 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/prokoudine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57467?v=4" alt="Alexandre Prokoudine"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/prokoudine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Alexandre Prokoudine</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Contributing Writer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>There’s well over 200 various addons for FreeCAD available just in the official add-on manager. Many more possibly flew under the radar or simply never have been shared with anybody.</p><p>For some developers, creating an add-on is a way to test ideas and see if they resonate with a larger audience. For others, it’s the first step towards contributing to FreeCAD itself. The add-on ecosystem is hugely important for the community at large.</p><p>But many great ideas die because the add-on implementation suffers from one or more common and avoidable mistakes:</p><ul><li>Not designed to make contributions from other developers easy.</li><li>Built with implementations of things that are core FreeCAD features.</li><li>Not built with good software practices in mind, think modular code, unit tests, separation of UI and non-UI logic.</li></ul><p>This isn’t a criticism of the addon developers. Nobody is expert in everything for many open-source contributors, writing an Add-on is their first experience contributing to a large project.</p><p>Over the last decade, I patched other people’s add-ons and wrote some of my own. In this post, I’d like to share what I think are best practices of developing 3rd-party add-ons for FreeCAD. There’s a technical and a design aspect to this.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-advice">Technical advice<a href="#technical-advice" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technical advice" title="Direct link to Technical advice">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="design-the-ui-with-qt-creator-and-use-the-ui-files-directly">Design the UI with QT Creator and use the .ui files directly.<a href="#design-the-ui-with-qt-creator-and-use-the-ui-files-directly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Design the UI with QT Creator and use the .ui files directly." title="Direct link to Design the UI with QT Creator and use the .ui files directly.">​</a></h3><p>There are several reasons why this is a great idea. First off, this makes the code simpler. Hundreds of lines of Qt code are replaced with a single line to load the .ui file like:</p><p><code>Form = FreeCADGui.PySideUic.loadUi(dialog.ui)</code></p><p>The UI logic becomes much cleaner and more testable. Secondly, UI designers are used to working with visual tools. They can often improve the look and feel of a dialog or task panel quickly. Using the UI files directly rather than hand-coding Qt or converting the .ui file to python makes it much easier for UI designers to contribute. The wiki has <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Manual:Creating_interface_tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lots of information</a> about designing and using .ui files.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="separate-the-ui-logic-from-the-application-logic">Separate the UI logic from the application logic.<a href="#separate-the-ui-logic-from-the-application-logic" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Separate the UI logic from the application logic." title="Direct link to Separate the UI logic from the application logic.">​</a></h3><p>From the beginning, FreeCAD was designed to run without the GUI at all. It’s amazing how much you can do with FreeCAD by calling it from external scripts. So it’s really frustrating to find a great piece of addon functionality that won’t work this way.</p><p>Ideally, the UI logic is separated from the rest of the application code. Designing software this way doesn’t come naturally to amateur programmers but it isn’t too difficult and is worth learning. Even a very simple addon or workbench should have at least two Python modules, one with the logic for managing the UI, getting input from the user, and displaying it. The second module does all the interesting stuff, and it should not import FreeCADGui.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stick-with-rules-of-thumb">Stick with rules of thumb<a href="#stick-with-rules-of-thumb" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stick with rules of thumb" title="Direct link to Stick with rules of thumb">​</a></h3><p>There are some very simple rules that help keep the code clean, readable, and testable. Like all heuristics, they aren’t written in stone and there are times to ignore them. That said, take the time to understand why they exist.</p><p><strong>No function longer than 200 lines of code.</strong> There are various recommendations regarding the length of a function, but 200 LOC seems like a reasonable maximum. The general idea is that a function should do just one logical thing and could be explained in one sentence. This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/475762/revisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of red flags</a> for when a function is too long should serve you well (thanks to Ryan Delucchi).</p><p><strong>No module longer than 1K lines of code.</strong> For pretty much the same reason — readability, maintainability etc. — Python modules shouldn’t be too long. Keeping python modules short has a subtle effect on code organization. It naturally encourages better encapsulation and separation of concerns, two key concepts in software development.</p><p><strong>Write pythonic code.</strong> Unlike communities around other programming languages, the Python community, is very opinionated about code conventions. Adhering to these conventions makes Python code more readable and more efficient. Here is a <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-write-pythonic-code-208ec1513c49" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very good overview</a> by Xiaoxu Gao of what makes code in Python “pythonic”.</p><p><strong>Use Black formatting.</strong> Code formatting is sometimes a contentious issue. Part of being ‘pythonic’ is adhering to a community standard for formatting. The standard is formalized in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PEP 8</a> which asserts a number of code style conventions.  Pycodestyle will check your code against those standards (and complain when you break them). <a href="https://github.com/psf/black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black</a> automatically reformats your Python code to comply with those conventions.</p><p><strong>Write unit tests first.</strong> Nobody likes writing unit tests but everyone likes having them. Regressions are easy to introduce and difficult to catch. Unit tests invert that by making regressions harder to introduce and easier to solve. They also have a subtle effect on how you program. When you have to write unit tests, you start to write more testable code. So write unit tests early on to stay on top of it.</p><p><strong>Make UI translatable from day 1.</strong> Popular addons tend to get translated into other languages. Designing an addon with localization in mind from the beginning means you free yourself from redesigning it later on to introduce UI translation support.</p><p><strong>Make user-facing objects parametric.</strong> If the addon adds document objects to the project and expects the user to interact with them after creation, the important attributes of the object should be exposed through properties. We’ve seen good ideas implemented in such a way that if the user makes an error during the creation of an object, the only recourse is to delete the object and restart. If the creation of an object involves a task panel, double-clicking on the object in the tree should re-open the same task panel and allow the user to change settings.

A good example of that is the <a href="https://github.com/shaise/FreeCAD_SheetMetal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheetmetal workbench</a>. There’s an interesting bit of logic that unfolds a shape to produce a flattened version. The unfolder is computationally intense and would benefit from being implemented in C++ rather than Python. A powerful and efficient unfolder might also have utility in other workbenches. It sure takes more time and effort to communicate with other developers, get these things written correctly and merged, but it makes addons simpler, faster, and more maintainable.</p><p>On the other hand, be on the lookout for things that already <em>are</em> in the core. Inexperienced developers often reinvent the wheel and do it poorly. Experienced developers communicate a lot. So when you design an addon, talk to your peers and discuss your design. It could very well be the case that something you need or already exists and works just right for you.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="design-advice">Design advice<a href="#design-advice" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Design advice" title="Direct link to Design advice">​</a></h2><p>FreeCAD has the <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/stylebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beginnings of a style book</a>. While work on it is ongoing, here are some important considerations.</p><p><strong>Don&#x27;t make the user think.</strong> In free and open-source software, the concepts of usability and discoverability are often overlooked. Do your best to design an addon with a straightforward workflow that gets users from A to Z in the least possible amount of time. Give the user a result with the minimal amount of input and let them revise and improve the result incrementally. A feature that requires the user to do many things exactly right before outputting anything at all is confusing and will be ignored by most users.</p><p><strong>Chunking.</strong> If there’s one thing you can do to make your user-interface and workflow better it is to group controls together so users can process them efficiently.</p><ul><li>Toolbars should have neither too many nor too few buttons. Seven, plus or minus two, is a guideline often invoked.</li><li>The buttons should be grouped logically. Consider that the user may hide the toolbar or drag it to another part of the screen. Menus should use separators to make them easier to process.</li><li>Dialogs should use group boxes, frames, and tabs to allow efficient recognition of controls.</li></ul><p><strong>Don’t just gravitate to workbenches.</strong> There seems to be a popular idea that a workbench is the right kind of addon for anything. And so there are some 3rd-party workbenches that should have been a non-workbench addon, an extension of an existing workbench, or even a core feature. But workbenches are destinations, if you build one, you should expect that people will park there for a while and will be unwilling to jump between workbenches all the time. So when you choose what type of an addon you are creating, think primarily of workflow and tasks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-to-do-next">What to do next<a href="#what-to-do-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What to do next" title="Direct link to What to do next">​</a></h2><p>If you are planning to write a new FreeCAD addon or improve one you have already created, I recommend paying close attention to <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Developer Guide</a>.

A very popular “offender” here is the geometry constraints toolbar in Sketcher. It has 18 different constraint options, more than most popular commercial CAD offerings like Fusion 360, Onshape, and Creo. That&#x27;s not a bad thing on its own, but it adds a lot of mileage when you need to dimension an entire complex sketch.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Constraint options in FreeCAD 0.21" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-0-21-ca0c28f136d7c2b19885bcdfac503e46.webp" width="1812" height="932" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Before joining Ondsel, Pierre-Louis Boyer (@paddle) started implementing a feature called <em>contextual constraints</em> to help users constrain faster. Since joining Ondsel, he has finished the <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch</a>, and after some discussion and code review it was merged to become part of future FreeCAD 1.0. This new feature is quite nice and surpasses what many commercial CAD applicaitons are able to do. So let’s take it for a drive and kick the tires!</p><p>When you select a geometric feature in a sketch, there’s a finite number of constraints you apply once you select the second feature. For example, if you select a line and then an endpoint of another line, your most meaningful option is a distance constraint. But if you select a line and then another line that’s at an angle to the first one, the angle constraint is the most meaningful option, and your other option is to make those lines equal.</p><p>Once you know that, you can devise a system that looks at the selected features, suggests the most sensible option by default, and allows switching between possible options easily. This is what the new contextual constraints system does. It helps apply constraints based on the context of what the user has already done.  You select the new Dimension option (<strong>D</strong> shortcut) and go over your entire sketch to constraint and dimension various parts of it.</p><p>The new option combines various pre-existing other ones: constraining distances, radii, diameters, angles, and a constraint lock.</p><p>Here is a quick example. Take two lines that have different length and are at a random angle and distance to each other:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Original state" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-step-0-5d05391d314dd9eaecbd7fe30f388611.webp" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Then select the Dimension option and set the length of the first line:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Length constraint" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-step-1-427a099a5d3ab3b750234d17830273bd.webp" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Set a distance between the two lines by clicking the line and then the closer endpoint of the second line:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Distance constraint" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-step-2-0ae4fd84ec5722aee371ff45753cb326.webp" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Constraint their angle by clicking the first line and the second line:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Angle constraining" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-step-3-14968feeaf87ffcfb733e6767264ecef.webp" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>And finally make both lines equal by clicking the first line and the second line and then pressing <strong>M</strong> to switch to the second contextual constraint option:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Equal length lines" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-step-4-bd02c7fc09bd19b9a686943a532a89a4.webp" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You can constrain this sketch further by clicking on an end point of one of the lines and setting a lock, all with the same Dimension option. Most importantly, all of the steps above are completed without needing to choose a different tool in the toolbar.</p><p>For cases, when you absolutely need to have quick access to individual constraint options (just like in v0.21 and earlier), you can continue using keyboard shortcuts or selecting those options in the drop-down list:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Individual options" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-individual-options-eb9ba3a20823e766d2a23393a353714f.webp" width="1547" height="836" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preserving that possibility</a> was one of the requests from users.</p><p>The new option also allows switching between complementary angles depending on the position of the mouse:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Switching between complementary angles" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-complementary-angles-ab3f4c2bfba4f9f2062f4dafad2a28f0.gif" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This implementation was possible thanks to active discussions both <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=4&amp;t=65521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the forum</a> and in the issue tracker.

We’ve talked about <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/better-github-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stale issues</a> on this blog before, and we can see in the above quote that ignored issues and PRs do have a real impact on contributor motivation and sentiment towards a project.

Maintainers that ignore PRs or let them get tangled up in dozens of comments (debating the right way to address a problem or implement a feature) can expect one-time or burned-out contributors, slower releases, and a lot of wasted effort on rebasing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-pr-is-too-large-to-effectively-review">The PR is too large to effectively review<a href="#the-pr-is-too-large-to-effectively-review" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The PR is too large to effectively review" title="Direct link to The PR is too large to effectively review">​</a></h3><p>PRs that do too many things or touch too much of the codebase at once pose a risk of unforeseen side effects. They’re just too unwieldy to review thoroughly (sometimes even <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#diff-limits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub won’t render the entire diff in the PR</a>), so the reviewer doesn’t feel comfortable taking responsibility for merging.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-goals-of-the-pr-are-too-obscure">The goals of the PR are too obscure<a href="#the-goals-of-the-pr-are-too-obscure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The goals of the PR are too obscure" title="Direct link to The goals of the PR are too obscure">​</a></h3><p>Some PRs don’t explain the original problem sufficiently for someone to be able to test their behavior. That’s one end of the spectrum—at the other, not everyone contributing to a project has the same use cases, goals, or needs. Once the project evolves beyond its initial purpose and scope, you can end up with PRs that touch or implement an obscure feature that maintainers don’t understand or feel confident in reviewing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="competing-solutions-exist">Competing solutions exist<a href="#competing-solutions-exist" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Competing solutions exist" title="Direct link to Competing solutions exist">​</a></h3><p>There are usually multiple ways to solve a problem. A PR that implements one solution can devolve into a debate about the merits of that approach over others, because no consensus on direction was reached ahead of time. Sometimes there is no precedent for the reviewer to fall back on, or they lack the institutional knowledge or context to make the call.</p><p>There’s a lot of overlap with our discussion of <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-topological-naming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why RealThunder’s branch with a topological naming fix for FreeCAD hasn’t been merged yet</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="solutions">Solutions<a href="#solutions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Solutions" title="Direct link to Solutions">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bring-alignment-forward">Bring alignment forward<a href="#bring-alignment-forward" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bring alignment forward" title="Direct link to Bring alignment forward">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/better-github-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Better issues</a> → better PRs. If you can find alignment (if not consensus) at the issue stage, you avoid a lot of the agonizing over philosophy and implementation in PRs.

‘TagTree is unsupported and not meant for use in a production Dart application, unless you&#x27;re willing to fork the code and fix any bugs you find yourself.’</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Or if a project is widely used but difficult to contribute to, you should say so up front, like this:
‘Contributing code is one of the more difficult ways to contribute to Guava, and is almost never what the project really needs most <!-- -->[...]<!-- --> We know it&#x27;s tempting to submit code before the feature is accepted, but this is not always a good use of your time.’” - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8713694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skybrian on Hacker News</a></p></blockquote><p>A <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributing policy</a> should, at the very least, tell contributors when to expect reviews and how to give their PR the best chance of getting merged.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reduce-the-burden-of-reviewing">Reduce the burden of reviewing<a href="#reduce-the-burden-of-reviewing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reduce the burden of reviewing" title="Direct link to Reduce the burden of reviewing">​</a></h3><p>You want reviewers to be able to focus on big-picture factors like the performance impact of a PR or alignment with project direction, not spending time on undifferentiated gruntwork.

Both the contributor and the maintainers have a responsibility to communicate effectively.</p><p>Contributors should make very few assumptions about what the maintainers already know, and make it extremely easy to understand the context of the PR, the original problem, how the solution works, and any concerns.
Maintainers should ensure that communication is ongoing. Using bots to bump PRs for updates helps to remind reviewers that a PR is outstanding, but also reassures the PR author that it hasn’t been forgotten (<a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/pull/8671#issuecomment-1681197585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for example</a>).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="progress-over-perfection">Progress over perfection<a href="#progress-over-perfection" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Progress over perfection" title="Direct link to Progress over perfection">​</a></h3><p>You can always iterate after merging.

When people are uncertain, they will defer to others. Everyone can end up differing and nobody takes action.</p><p>To combat PR stagnation, FreeCAD has started having synchronous merge meetings including maintainers and contributors to discuss next steps on outstanding PRs. This live session is important and serves a number of purposes:</p><ul><li>Teasing out concerns and unspoken worry</li><li>Multiple contributors share the risk of merging a PR</li><li>Multiple perspectives put concerns into proper context</li><li>Multiple perspectives offer novel and productive outcomes</li></ul><p>Maintainers are referees in the meeting, making sure each contribution is evaluated according to the process. Did it start with an issue? Was there some consensus on the solution? Is the code passing CI?</p><p>We won’t hesitate to kick something back if a contributor blatantly ignores the process, but we try not to be militant and will merge good-faith contributions. Sometimes this means merging things we are (mildly) uncomfortable with because the contributor did everything by the book. When that happens, process says you merge.</p><p>What does this look like in practice?</p><ul><li>“Let’s ask <!-- -->[another contributor]<!-- --> for a code review, she knows about this module”</li><li>“This PR is really doing two different things. Let’s ask the author to split”</li><li>“This PR and that other one are in conflict. Let’s get those two people talking”</li><li>“This is low risk.

We learn which maintainers have a ‘bigger picture’ of the project and community, and the ones who don’t get coaching by participating in the process.

But the truth is, this is a much older conversation that has been going on in the community for years now: at FOSDEM, in the forum, and in various other venues and social channels. The hackathon in Vancouver was a perfect opportunity for the developers community to set some boundaries for v1.0.</p><p>We ended up formalizing a list of <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/roadmap/next.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4 major items</a> for the v1.0 roadmap that we think are a must-have to constitute the next release. None of these items are big news, we’ve all known about them for a while: the complete topological naming fix, a default Assembly workbench, a new implementation of a materials system, and the first-run wizard.</p><p>So let’s cast a quick glance at these items and talk about respective challenges.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-toponaming-fix">The toponaming fix<a href="#the-toponaming-fix" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The toponaming fix" title="Direct link to The toponaming fix">​</a></h2><p>We’ve already discussed this topic in the past, the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/milestone-toponaming-fix-phase-2-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest post from July</a> covers the current state of affairs in detail. It looks like we’ve already done a very difficult part of this project. Further work is not going to be easy, but the foundation for the next phases of the fix is sound.</p><p>The team is now approaching the third phase of the fix (out of five), there’s an <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/8432#issuecomment-1676433915" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">initial plan available</a>. As the third phase is where FreeCAD actually starts using the new toponaming infrastructure, this will be a perfect opportunity for new contributors to get involved. The <a href="https://t.me/toponamingchat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated Telegram chat</a> is the right place to start.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-default-assembly-workbench">The default Assembly workbench<a href="#the-default-assembly-workbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The default Assembly workbench" title="Direct link to The default Assembly workbench">​</a></h2><p>This is one of the more challenging items on the list of v1.0 deliverables. We think FreeCAD should have a capable assembly workbench and that really means two things:</p><ol><li>A workbench where the user configures the assembly, adding parts and establishing relationships between them.</li><li>A solver capable of resolving those relationships and moving the parts of the assembly appropriately.</li></ol><p>All that should be the default experience, no third-party add-ons.</p><p>Dr. Aik-Siong Koh, who is an employee at Ondsel, published the <a href="https://github.com/Ondsel-Development/OndselSolver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code of his solver</a> during the hackathon. This will be one of the foundations of the coming Assembly workbench.</p><p>For the user-facing assembly workbench, a lot of work remains. One of the challenges will be coming up with a user interface and workflow that are both discoverable, straightforward, and expandable. It doesn’t need to cover every use case.  Remember that the existing assembly options are still viable and may serve different users well. Rather the integrated solution should strive to be robust, simple to use, consistent with the rest of FreeCAD, and an excellent platform for future expansion.</p><p>The main challenge here will be building a team similar to the one we have for the TNP fix — a mix of Ondsel employees, FreeCAD maintainers, and 3rd party contributors. This has proven to be a great balance between interested parties, and we want to replicate that success.</p><p>The project will be managed as a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/7/views/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub project in the FreeCAD organization</a>, with cards and issues.  Similarly to the toponaming project, we’ll work in small incremental pull requests and merge the changes directly to the master branch rather than wait until the workbench is fully functional. An initial barebone implementation has already been merged to the main development branch.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="materials">Materials<a href="#materials" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Materials" title="Direct link to Materials">​</a></h2><p>The existing materials system in FreeCAD is overly simplistic, all over the place, and doesn’t even scratch the surface of what users really need it to do. So the program absolutely needs a solid foundation.</p><p>Earlier this year, we posted an <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-needs-a-better-materials-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">implementation proposal</a> for a new materials system written in collaboration with Dave Carter who volunteered to actually do the work. Dave is, in fact, knee-deep in that project and has made a lot of progress (the branch with his code is <a href="https://github.com/davesrocketshop/FreeCAD/tree/post_21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public</a>). Moreover, users have been <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=78242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very supportive</a> of his effort.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Editor for new material cards" src="/assets/images/materials-new-cards-editor-b1bae2dd4b5c40eea6bc33c2082c6ca8.webp" width="837" height="574" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The first pull request <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has already been filed</a> and is undergoing review. Further plan with materials is to apply the toponaming development model: break all further work down into small pieces, so that any developer could be part of that effort. Once the initial patch has been merged and further work has been decomposed into small items, more developers can join the effort. All further work will be done in pull requests. This will make it possible to deliver the minimum viable implementation in time for v1.0.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-run-wizard">First-run wizard<a href="#first-run-wizard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to First-run wizard" title="Direct link to First-run wizard">​</a></h2><p>FreeCAD has a difficult learning curve. Improving the initial user experiences is a topic that resurfaces regularly. We even covered that in a recent blog post. Here is the gist of the issue.</p><p>First of all, people can’t really agree on the scope of the first-run wizard. There are literally dozens of settings that users requested to be editable when you run the program for the first time. But when you dig deeper into the reasoning, several things become obvious.</p><p>First there are configuration settings for which a single default will never suffice. Language and the unit system are the two that come to mind.</p><p>Some configuration options appear to be personal preference but might also have more significant usability implications. For example themes and colors are personal preference, but they become extremely important if you suffer from color deficiency.  Users will never agree with each other about that, so those have to be easily configurable. </p><p>Other things that people want to configure should probably be solved in other ways. A great example of this is configuring which workbenches are available and active for a new user.
Should the system present a bewildering array of workbenches to a new user or should it hide potentially useful tools in an effort to be streamlined? Reasonable people disagree. In this case, the right answer might be to improve the Start workbench. This would provide a fast track to the workbench based on that task that they need to accomplish. Initial mockup was created and then turned into a <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull request</a> by Qewer during the hackathon. This patch has already been accepted and will be part of v1.0.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Updated start screen" src="/assets/images/updated-start-screen-43314754a338a6b5419904668bee5343.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>On yet another level, this is a conversation about terminology. A much-discussed example here is the distinction between Part and PartDesign — users inevitably learn to understand the difference, but they are off to a rocky start, and there are some technical issues to take care of on the developers’ part.</p><p>Hence the plan is to come up with a minimal implementation of the first-run wizard, one that would deal with things that users are split over regardless of how sensible defaults are, and then see take a holistic approach to dealing with the rest.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="and-now-the-fun-part-can-we-get-v10-out-by-fosdem-2024">And now the fun part: can we get v1.0 out by FOSDEM 2024?<a href="#and-now-the-fun-part-can-we-get-v10-out-by-fosdem-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to And now the fun part: can we get v1.0 out by FOSDEM 2024?" title="Direct link to And now the fun part: can we get v1.0 out by FOSDEM 2024?">​</a></h2><p>We think that these goals are within reach and it should be possible to release FreeCAD 1.0 in time for the next FOSDEM. Here’s our thinking behind this goal.</p><p>The TNP fix and the new Materials system are at the stage where the nature and the amount of work yet to be done are fairly predictable, and a large part of the heavy-lifting has already been done.</p><p>The initial Assembly workbench will be a challenging project, but now that we have a solver, we can start working on designing UX/UI around common use cases.</p><p>The design and the implementation of the first-run wizard itself would be a minor development effort, and there are people in the community who already spent a considerable amount of time creating mockups and even writing code. The challenging part will be taking a holistic approach to dealing with configuration and improving initial user experience, but we can make this effort span across multiple releases, there is so much to improve anyway.</p><p>To reiterate, v1.0 will definitely have changes apart from these 4 items. What we are aiming for is to start making development more predictable. Gaining some focus will help the team with both planning their work and managing expectations of FreeCAD users.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad/">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/development/">development</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-1d4df470ffd929076b7ae604f6c49878.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/dont-lose-your-open-source-soul/">Don’t lose your (open-source) soul: why we founded Ondsel as a public benefit company</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 1, 2023</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><blockquote><p>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
-Mark 8:36</p></blockquote><p>Late last year I was talking with <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Core Ventures</a> about the possibility of starting Ondsel.  It was exciting to hear from people outside the FreeCAD community who shared the vision that this software was important and could be so much more than it already is. As the idea of actually starting a company took hold, the first important decision was which legal structure the new company would have. Two things that I read deeply affected me and shaped the final decision.</p><p>The first was <a href="https://www.cooleygo.com/delaware-public-benefit-corporation-is-it-right-for-you-a-five-part-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article by Jen Barnette that highlighted five considerations for being a public benefits corporation</a> (PBC).</p><p>At a time when ambition often clashes with integrity, the formation of Ondsel as a Public Benefit Company (PBC) should stand as a testament to our belief in conscious entrepreneurship. The ethos of open-source software, characterized by collaboration and transparency, frequently finds itself at odds with the profit-driven dynamics of the modern tech landscape. Ondsel&#x27;s genesis as a PBC exemplifies a commitment to upholding the soul of open-source values, even in the pursuit of success.</p><p>Open-source software, a cornerstone of the digital age, embodies the spirit of sharing, transparency, and collective betterment. But, as projects mature, they can wrestle with the challenges of sustainability. Developers who once dedicated themselves to a project out of love find their efforts ensnared by financial considerations and proprietary boundaries, straying from the core essence of openness. Ondsel&#x27;s inception as a PBC is a direct response—a proactive stance to prevent the dilution of these core values.</p><p>The five points that Jen described meshed well with my own thinking and I made sure to include them in <a href="https://ondsel.com/handbook/About/public_benefit_corp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our own handbook</a>. I revisit them often to make sure my thinking doesn’t drift away from the core values we started with.</p><p>The second thing I read was Simon Sinek’s book <a href="https://simonsinek.com/books/the-infinite-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Infinite Game</em></a>.  He suggests that a company should have a “just cause”  that inspires people because it explains <em>why</em> you’re doing what you do.</p><p>For me, this one was easy.</p><p>Human beings are creative and social creatures. Not everyone creates physical things but everyone is a maker of ideas. We enjoy sharing our ideas, talking about them and improving them. Sometimes those ideas turn into physical things that have beauty, utility, and value. These days, you need tools to express your ideas so others can build on them and we need everyone’s best ideas.</p><p>People deserve access to tools to help them express their ideas, share them with other people, and use them to produce useful things that benefit all of us. Ondsel wants to make powerful, efficient, and beautiful design tools available to more people.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ondsel/">Ondsel</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-937b8ceecfc87f17e3d9a3e5d92f2482.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/freecad-needs-a-first-run-wizard/">FreeCAD needs a first-run wizard, but nobody knows what it should do</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-08-27T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 27, 2023</time> · <!-- -->13 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/prokoudine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57467?v=4" alt="Alexandre Prokoudine"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/prokoudine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Alexandre Prokoudine</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Contributing Writer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>FreeCAD is commonly criticized for being difficult to get started with. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quote 1" src="/assets/images/quote1-62e8e4811650f6e6373d08f546f83e18.webp" width="1421" height="199" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quote 2" src="/assets/images/quote2-9bdfb35d09fdf1d321bb9843df2bbe1f.webp" width="1421" height="199" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This criticism, while possibly overstated, is valid.</p><ul><li>Features get more development attention and the UX/UI design is usually an afterthought and “anything goes”. As a result, there’s not much consistency across the program.</li><li>The learning curve for modern CAD systems is a wall. There is even occasionally pushback against simplifying UX, because “CAD programs are <em>supposed</em> to be difficult and take a lot of time to learn&quot;. Effort to improve UI is seen as &quot;dumbing it down”.</li><li>The program is trying to be many things at once: a 2D drafting program, a 3D design program, an Arch/BIM program, a CNC program, a structural analysis program — and that’s just a subset of workbenches available by default. All the while not much thought has been given to help users navigate the options when they see it for the first time, or customize FreeCAD for their use cases.</li><li>Terminology used in the program is inconsistent and confusing. Part vs PartDesign is one of the recurring topics in the community. But also “path” could mean a toolpath, a sweep path, or a file path depending on where in the program the word is used. These are just a couple examples.</li></ul><p>For a long time there have been calls for a first-run wizard (FRW) as the way to fix some of these problems. If you are not familiar with the concept, the idea behind FRW is a feature that runs the first time a user launches a program and helps orient the user to the software by allowing them to choose how the program will look and behave or by onboarding them in other ways.</p><p>While investigating this feature request, we looked into what other programs have to offer, and our conclusion is that while something is needed, this request is problematic and the specific solution has poor consensus.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-wrong-with-the-feature-request">What’s wrong with the feature request?<a href="#whats-wrong-with-the-feature-request" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s wrong with the feature request?" title="Direct link to What’s wrong with the feature request?">​</a></h2><p>First and foremost, the <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/5772" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue</a> is poorly defined. This issue predates the current contributing policy, it doesn’t start by identifying the problem but jumps immediately to the solution. People have seen similar solutions in other applications and have an intuition about them. But the notion of a first-run wizard brings different ideas to mind. In fact, our research showed that these tools are employed to address at least three different problems:</p><ul><li>User preferences make a big difference to usability but the settings are difficult to find or scattered in many places.</li><li>The optimum configuration of the software varies depending on the specific task the user is undertaking.</li><li>Important features are occasionally overlooked by users leading to frustration and increased support demand on the forum.</li></ul><p>These are three very different problems and their solutions are unlikely to be the same thing. It makes sense to address them independently.</p><p>Even if we narrow the focus and assume the feature request is only about customizing the software for the user’s needs, we still have a challenge. Consider this bewildering list of things that people have suggested should be configurable when you first run FreeCAD. We call it The Problematic Wishlist:</p><ul><li>Simple vs advanced layout (e.g. don’t show FEM workbench to a newbie, show less buttons in toolbars etc.)</li><li>Which workbenches (WBs) should be visible in the UI, with presets (Mechanical CAD, Arch/BIM etc.)</li><li>What WB is selected on startup</li><li>UI language</li><li>Units and unit schemes</li><li>Theme (dark/light/classic)</li><li>Enabling/disabling Treeview Glass theme</li><li>Icon theme</li><li>Highlight color</li><li>Icon size</li><li>Font size</li><li>Viewport background color</li><li>Navigation style</li><li>Enabling/disabling warnings in weekly builds</li><li>Enabling/disabling “What’s This?” button</li><li>Monitor aspect ratio selection for optimized layouts</li><li>Panel layout options</li><li>Default file storage location</li><li>Autosave and backup policy</li><li>Authoring and license info</li></ul><p>While it may be technically possible to implement all this in a first-run wizard,  it would be a perfect example of creating a bigger problem by trying to fix a smaller one.  It would be overwhelming to the user trying to get started and would complicate development since configuration would have to be maintained in both the FRW and the system preferences.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-other-programs-do">What other programs do<a href="#what-other-programs-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What other programs do" title="Direct link to What other programs do">​</a></h2><p>As part of the research phase, we looked at what other programs offer in terms of customizing UX the first time you run a program. The question we asked was just this: do other teams solve the same issues by offering a first-run wizard or do they do something else?</p><p>We started with CAD programs and then moved to other kinds of applications (3D modeling, image editing, vector graphics editing, audio production). Basically, any sophisticated program with lots of configuration options, aimed at professionals and designed for multiple use cases is worth looking at.</p><p>Right off the bat, among non-FOSS <strong>CAD</strong> packages, only BricsCAD provides something that vaguely approaches a first-run wizard. Every time you launch the program, a dialog asks what kind of work the user wants to do: 2D drafting, 3D modeling, mechanical design, or BIM. The same launcher window also asks whether the user wants metric or imperial units. And this is it. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Start screen in BricsCAD" src="/assets/images/bricscad-start-screen-7fab41fb6de424cef5f34bb217272b6b.webp" width="1420" height="946" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>But you don’t even need a dialog for that. Multiple programs provide a simple choice over the type of project you create. In some cases, it’s just a drop-down list of project types or a library of templates.</p><p>The only two programs that do have a first-run wizard are FOSS programs. LibreCAD asks for the default unit, GUI language, and command language. QCad asks for GUI language, default unit, default paper size, decimal point, and background color (black or white). Not too surprising, as the former is a fork of the latter.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="First-run wizard in LibreCAD" src="/assets/images/librecad-frw-3615f4974dfd0420b3b3bb9927b8051a.webp" width="1102" height="484" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The situation is pretty much the same across other industries we looked at.</p><p>Blender seems to be the only major <strong>3D modeling</strong> package that has a first-run wizard. You can set UI language, shortcuts preset, right-click vs left-click for selection, spacebar behavior, UI theme.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="First-run wizard in Blender" src="/assets/images/blender-frw-82c25b3c77508dffe5df53091f099492.webp" width="884" height="825" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>None of the big boys in <strong>image editing</strong>, like Adobe Photoshop and Affinity Photo, have a first-run wizard. Ironically, GIMP is the program that used to have one, got rid of it, but is likely to have one again. In short, the original wizard asked questions that could be automatically detected from various system settings, and users found it annoying. But then developers made changes to defaults (enforced default dark theme and symbolic/colorless icons, as well as grouped tool icons in the toolbar), and that, too, annoyed half the user base. So they want to reintroduce the first-run wizard at some point in the future.</p><p>Similarly, Inkscape seems to be the only <strong>vector graphics</strong> program with a first-run wizard: you can choose canvas look (transparent checkerboard, white opaque etc.), shortcuts theme, icons theme, dark vs system UI theme.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="First-run wizard in Inkscape" src="/assets/images/inkscape-frw-7f8a721255348eae90c578fa4febd3d3.webp" width="1403" height="1333" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Among proprietary <strong>digital audio workstations</strong> Cubase seems to be the only one that bothers users with questions, and even that during installation when you need to select a preferred audio interface. Once again, a FOSS program is an exception: the first time you run Ardour, a wizard asks for GUI and font scaling and the default folder for new sessions. The first part of that, however, is a toolkit limitation. Ardour still uses GTK2 for some part of its UI, and GTK2 is notoriously oblivious of HiDPI displays.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="First-run wizard in Ardour" src="/assets/images/ardour-frw-681f780085b156b00152d296962d0466.webp" width="760" height="542" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Across many industries, developers recognize that learning to use their software efficiently takes time, so they build links to training materials into the user interface. This is something FOSS developers are beginning to do, too. For example, MuseScore has links to educational videos on YouTube, and FreeCAD has links to the wiki.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Learning center in MuseScore" src="/assets/images/musescore-learning-center-76599ccbe989c6d526f0472515bbad3e.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So what did we learn from this?</p><ul><li><strong>Very few programs actually provide a first-run wizard.</strong> Proprietary programs typically enforce a certain choice of defaults even for controversial things like the look and feel, but, to their credit, usually make it rather easy to customize certain things.</li><li><strong>There are obvious polarizing topics.</strong> Some of the defaults are things that users just can’t stop arguing about. This is exactly what first-run wizards in FOSS programs like Blender and Inkscape focus on.</li><li><strong>Measure units surprisingly do not cause all that much controversy.</strong> Figuring out the right units from locale settings is perfectly doable, so it’s possible that this is why very few CAD programs even bother exposing those when you run them the first time or create a new project. Typically, there is a global configuration that applies to new projects and a simple way to override it on a per-project basis (an unfinished patch for the latter <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exists</a> for FreeCAD).</li><li><strong>There’s usually a very obvious way to get to the right tools.</strong> Applications like Inventor make it very easy to create a 2D design or a 3D model. Usually, it’s just one or two clicks away, and the UI for that is in a very obvious place.</li><li><strong>CAD programs usually have a learning center for newly arrived users.</strong> This is something FreeCAD already does, but there are ways to improve it. A topic for another day.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Learning center in Autocad LT" src="/assets/images/autocad-lt-learning-center-01cdd9a60a51c2e7812d8769545c5c43.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-proposal">Our proposal<a href="#our-proposal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our proposal" title="Direct link to Our proposal">​</a></h2><p>Based on our findings, we think it’s best to attack the issue of suboptimal first user experience from three angles: minimal first-run wizard, better defaults, and continuous UX/UI improvement.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="minimal-first-run-wizard">Minimal first-run wizard<a href="#minimal-first-run-wizard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Minimal first-run wizard" title="Direct link to Minimal first-run wizard">​</a></h3><p>Let’s learn from the experience of other projects. Right-click selection in Blender was a huge annoyance for new users right up to the point where left-click selection was finally implemented and the first-run wizard started offering the choice between the two options. The lesson here is that there will always be things that users are split over, we are not going to change everyone’s mind, ever.</p><p>Therefore the first part of the solution is to build a minimalistic first-run wizard that will cover just that: visual style, navigation style, units, GUI language. We can further refine the wizard based on feedback from users. Designing and implementing the dialog is not too complicated, and there have been several approaches to do so already.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="better-defaults">Better defaults<a href="#better-defaults" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Better defaults" title="Direct link to Better defaults">​</a></h3><p>Certain things on the wishlist above could absolutely be better defaults. For example, we can enable backups by default and set a sensible number of versions to be saved.</p><p>The tricky part here is coming up with a definition of what constitutes a sensible default. This is something we will have to further explore.</p><p>In our experience, it’s useful to keep each conversation about defaults narrowly focused. For example, we’ve already had a lively if slightly heated discussion over disabling some of the workbenches in the workbench selector by default. Breaking that conversation into several dedicated GitHub issues has helped to keep the discussion productive, so now there is a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub project</a> for cleaning up the workbench selector.</p><p>This task of making good defaults will likely never be 100% completed as FreeCAD keeps changing. So we should treat it as a continuous effort.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="continuous-uxui-improvement">Continuous UX/UI improvement<a href="#continuous-uxui-improvement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Continuous UX/UI improvement" title="Direct link to Continuous UX/UI improvement">​</a></h3><p>This last part of the solution is a lot more interesting. Let’s analyze the rest and see how we can improve the UX/UI to deliver a better initial user experience and maybe remove the need for configuring certain things when users run the program for the first time.</p><p>Here is an example. One of the ideas for the first-run wizard is to allow users to configure what workbenches they want visible by default. To reiterate, someone who, for all we know, is probably looking at the program for the first time, is supposed to somehow guess what workbenches they actually need without having ever used them. That doesn’t sound like a very likely scenario.</p><p>And then some experienced users could have different uses for the program. You can be an architect who needs Draft, Arch/BIM, and just a few more WBs. But you also tinker with stuff in your spare time, so PartDesign and Path are no strangers to you.</p><p>Basically, FreeCAD needs to adapt the UI based on context. There are several established approaches to deal with that. Named workspaces is one of them. But another approach is to improve the start screen. If you create an architectural project, you automatically get a certain set of workbenches available to you. You can further refine that selection, if you want to, but the default user experience will already be streamlined for you to a large extent based on the type of a project you create.</p><p>The first step towards that has already been done. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Qewer</a>, v1.0 will be coming with an update start screen listing several typical new projects that are basically a fast track to a particular workbench.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="New start page in FreeCAD" src="/assets/images/freecad-new-start-page-8504802fe5942707cae5aaa1488034ec.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The full implementation of that would eliminate two items from the wishlist: 1) what WBs should be visible in the UI, and 2) what WB is selected on startup.</p><p>This kind of a holistic approach to designing UX/UI should serve the project much better than what we have had so far. We also don’t have to deliver the full UX/UI redesign of FreeCAD for v1.0, this kind of refinement can go on for as many development cycles as we can handle.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next" title="Direct link to What’s next">​</a></h2><p>Improving the user’s initial experience of FreeCAD is not a single work effort.  There has been good work done in this area already including an <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/5772" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing discussion</a> about the first-run wizard in the issue tracker, but discrete, solvable issues need to be extracted from that and solutions built for each of them.</p><p>The first issue to address is the narrowly defined set of configuration options  which users routinely disagree about: language, units, navigation style, and theme.</p><p>Tailoring the application to the task should be addressed by improving the start page and providing better defaults whenever possible.  As noted above, some work has already been done.</p><p>That leaves the more subjective work of explicitly educating the user about FreeCAD conventions, UI tools, shortcuts, and the general UX/UI improvements.   Both of these need more research and feedback from the community. This is an area where we need better and more actionable data from community power users and moderators about where users are confused.</p><p>There will likely be a GitHub project focusing on UX/UI cleanup. Stay tuned for more news on that.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad/">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/development/">development</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-bef339104e38cfa01f647679864147bb.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/archeologists-will-study-the-bones-of-your-pull-request/">Someday an archeologist will study the bones of your pull request</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-08-10T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 10, 2023</time> · <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://www.thebasementoffice.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="/img/Rebecca-Dodd-profile.JPEG" alt="Rebecca Dodd"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://www.thebasementoffice.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rebecca Dodd</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Contributing Writer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-do-we-see-a-lot-of-first-time-contributors-to-the-path-workbench">Why do we see a lot of first-time contributors to the Path Workbench?<a href="#why-do-we-see-a-lot-of-first-time-contributors-to-the-path-workbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why do we see a lot of first-time contributors to the Path Workbench?" title="Direct link to Why do we see a lot of first-time contributors to the Path Workbench?">​</a></h2><p>Besides working on <a href="https://ondsel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ondsel</a>, I mostly work on the <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Path_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Path Workbench</a>. Path has a unique user base made up of hobbyists and machinists. These people are using Path to generate G-code for the CNC machines and the code almost always has to be tailored for a specific machine. Once you’ve edited the G-code once or twice, it’s natural to want to customize your postprocessor and that means editing a little Python code. Occasionally, one step leads to another and the user wants to contribute their changes ‘upstream’ so they can be used by others. It’s a common story and is, in fact, exactly how I got involved in open-source development.</p><p>As a maintainer of FreeCAD, I’ve spoken to lots of first-time contributors. I generally coach them through the PR process rather than doing it for them. Once they get a PR merged, they get a real thrill from it.

By choosing open source, especially younger projects, you accept that the product or tool may not be fully formed yet.</p><p>The experience of using an open-source alternative like FreeCAD vs. a proprietary product can be frustrating. The common objections are the absence of a slick and intuitive UI, and missing documentation. The nature of open-source projects is that they aren’t optimized for attracting new users:</p><blockquote><p>“FreeCAD has no goal of market penetration or profit, nor of training neophytes.

Many see this as something built on a shifting base, but, somehow thousands of people around the world manage to get things done.</p><p>For better or worse, there are no bounds on what or how the sandcastles are built.

What do you get by making that trade? Whether you’re a hobbyist creator or trying to adopt FreeCAD for your workplace, the greater benefits of FreeCAD include:</p><ul><li>Not being <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-adoption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">locked into a subscription</a> model from a capricious vendor</li><li>Complete transparency to both inspect the code and see the roadmap for future developments</li><li>You can work on your local machine instead of being tied to a web application</li><li><em>You can influence the product</em> </li></ul><p>You can have an impact on the velocity and trajectory of the project.

Contributing to open source and shaping the direction of a project can be fun and rewarding, but it’s also difficult and <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/contribution-barriers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can be intimidating for newcomers</a>.

We’ve only been working on software like this for a few decades and with the millions of copies, some of them are likely to survive for a very, VERY long time.</p><p>In the far distant future, the equivalent of archeologists will sift through old data to reconstruct the history of what happened in the past. Just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William Rathje studies modern garbage</a>, someone will eventually get the idea to systematically study Git histories to understand the culture of distributed work and collaborative software development.</p><p>Our contributions may be more timeless than we realize.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Laptop with Stickers" src="/assets/images/laptopstickers-d49faf5314671ebbd674ecc03552cc8c.jpg" width="1274" height="834" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="addendum-heres-something-i-would-love-to-see">Addendum: Here’s something I would love to see...<a href="#addendum-heres-something-i-would-love-to-see" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Addendum: Here’s something I would love to see..." title="Direct link to Addendum: Here’s something I would love to see...">​</a></h2><p>If there’s anyone from GitHub or GitLab reading, you could make it easier for open-source projects to reward contributors.

Some of the Ondsel team members have been regular contributors to FreeCAD for many years, but this is the first time we participated in a development cycle as a commercial entity.

The user community has been nothing short of awesome. The maintainers have been professional, supportive and responsive, same as usual.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="concerns-and-response">Concerns and Response<a href="#concerns-and-response" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Concerns and Response" title="Direct link to Concerns and Response">​</a></h2><p>As a commercial company, our biggest concern was predictability in the development process.  We wanted to know … <em>needed</em> to know… that effort we spend on development wouldn’t be wasted. We also had to have some assurance that releases would happen in time to support our corporate goals. </p><p>Early on, we raised our concern that the development methodology was too unpredictable.  It wasn’t clear which pull requests would be accepted or even who would make the decision. Pull requests would often get stuck in limbo or even denied after significant work was done. For a new startup, the risk of that happening was too great. The core developers and maintainers responded by implementing a <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clear policy for contributing</a> to the FreeCAD source and defined how those contributions would be handled.</p><p>Another major concern was how dependent the project had become on individual expertise.  Many important things were not documented and only lived in the minds of key people. In some cases only a few people knew how to do key tasks, and losing those people from the project was a major risk. The community agreed, and that’s one of the reasons we are heavily invested in building the <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer’s Handbook</a> in collaboration with Chris Hennes, WandererFan, and other FreeCAD contributors and members of the <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Project Association</a>.</p><blockquote><p>I think as a team we made tremendous strides during the 0.21 cycle, particularly in formalizing the role of a maintainer and setting clearer expectations about what maintainers are responsible for. The creation of the Developer Handbook was a major step forward for all of us, as was the creation of CONTRIBUTING.md. We still have more work to do actually implementing the ideals in those documents, but at least having the goals written down is a big step forward. — Chris Hennes, FreeCAD maintainer, the FPA board member and founder</p></blockquote><p>Implementing the policies and starting the handbook helped, but even with the best intentions and tools, development is <em>hard</em>. The FreeCAD project has a lot of contributors, just keeping track of the release, issues, and pull requests was taxing everyone.  </p><p>We started investigating the functionality GitHub provides to manage <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projects</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/discussions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussions</a>.  We used this first for the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toponaming project</a> and then, with the addition of Milestones, we started the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Release Dashboard</a> to give everyone a clear picture of where we are on the current release.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="1.0 release dashboard on GitHub" src="/assets/images/release-dashboard-4f81a69a64acfb23b460a85e1896ac30.webp" width="2687" height="1157" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The dashboard is helping to focus attention but PRs still sit too long.  Even with clear accountability for maintainers, it is often difficult to know if a given PR <em>should</em> be merged. Nobody is expert on everything, and merge decisions often come with a certain amount of risk. Lately the maintainers have started addressing this by reviewing the outstanding PR queue as a group in live meetings. Individual PRs are discussed and decisions made in realtime. Often PRs get merged immediately. Others get flagged for followup or moved to a later milestone. The decision about how to proceed is shared with many people contributing wisdom.  </p><blockquote><p>Now we have a much, much clearer, predictable, foreseeable and transparent process that can be (and has been) undertaken by more people. This is a very important step towards having more regular releases in the future. — Yorik Van Havre, Arch and BIM maintainer, the FPA chairperson and founder</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-freecad-truly-needs-is-a-shared-vision">What FreeCAD truly needs is… a shared vision<a href="#what-freecad-truly-needs-is-a-shared-vision" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What FreeCAD truly needs is… a shared vision" title="Direct link to What FreeCAD truly needs is… a shared vision">​</a></h2><p>FreeCAD development still has its challenges. We still don’t have broad consensus on where the application goes from here. Since its beginning, the project has proceeded forward with developers working on whichever features they were interested in. That’s part of the appeal of an open-source project, and we hope it never changes. A clear roadmap, however, would give some structure and help avoid conflict. There are some humble beginnings of a <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roadmap</a>, but it still needs further work.</p><p>Lots of discussion happened during the 0.21 development cycle that helped clarify the road to v1.0. Some of these topics we’ve already written about extensively on this blog, including <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assembly</a> and <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-needs-a-better-materials-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>. Other ideas, like a first-run wizard, have gotten some preliminary attention but need more planning and discussion. We are looking forward to the upcoming hackathon in Vancouver as an opportunity to further refine the roadmap.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wins-and-challenges-for-the-entire-freecad-team">Wins and challenges for the entire FreeCAD team<a href="#wins-and-challenges-for-the-entire-freecad-team" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wins and challenges for the entire FreeCAD team" title="Direct link to Wins and challenges for the entire FreeCAD team">​</a></h2><p><strong>The FreeCAD community is getting bigger and more spread-out.</strong> We now have a wide range of experts on many topics, which is great for a better understanding of problems users have and thus finding better solutions. At the same time, it’s now harder to get consensus and to get the word out about initiatives.</p><blockquote><p>There were several high points for me in 0.21. One of those was the help I got from members of the community: some contributed code, some did testing, some explained the arcania of technical drawing. — WandererFan, TechDraw maintainer, the FPA board member and founder</p></blockquote><p><strong>The FPA really came into its own.</strong> Donations from end users have been strong and reflect how much the greater community wants to see FreeCAD succeed. But an important challenge for the FPA going forward is managing these donations effectively. There’s no doubt that paid-development and contract work will be part of the future.</p><blockquote><p>I think we are making a better work of organizing for a release. The presence of the FPA and the development grants are opening up opportunities that where previously not there and it’s giving some good initial results, I expect this to only get better next cycle! — Adrián Insaurralde Avalos, maintainer and release manager of FreeCAD</p></blockquote><p><strong>The project is getting better at taking feedback.</strong> Improving the contribution process made us focus much more on getting good feedback from users: Conversations are now happening increasingly often in pull requests and issues on GitHub. The team also did a very successful <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=658200#p658200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complaints session</a> at FOSDEM this year. Overall, the improvement is in the quality of discussions. Once you formulate an issue as a problem to be solved, you end up with atomic tasks that are easier to accomplish. The inevitable challenge here is that now the project has a backlog of existing issues that need to be refactored and tailored to this new way of dealing with issues.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-ondsel-is-doing-and-whats-next">What Ondsel is doing and what’s next<a href="#what-ondsel-is-doing-and-whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Ondsel is doing and what’s next" title="Direct link to What Ondsel is doing and what’s next">​</a></h2><p>Ondsel is building a service that makes FreeCAD more usable and useful to commercial users and teams.  We absolutely need FreeCAD to be the kind of software that people rave about and can’t recommend enough. So we spend a lot of time improving it for users.</p><p>Our visible contributions to v0.21 were mostly improving the user interface and workflow.  We made contributions to the Preferences dialog, improved the UX/UI of Fillet, Chamfer, Draft, and Thickness tools in the Part Design workbench. We redesigned the image plane settings and fixed bugs in the core and the Path workbench.</p><p>Many of our contributions are less visible.  We have also been working on larger projects that will also benefit the entire ecosystem but will take longer to bear fruit.</p><p>We’re leading the project to integrate RealThunder’s fix for the notorious toponaming issue. The first 2 phases out of 5 are now complete (see this <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/milestone-toponaming-fix-phase-2-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent blog post</a> about it).</p><p>After <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">researching existing options</a> for creating and solving assemblies in FreeCAD, we settled on writing a solver of our own. Dr. Aik-Siong Koh has made significant progress towards a assembly solver based on his existing code originally written in Smalltalk. So far, the new solver can create an assembly and perform kinematics of a piston-crank system. We are also looking for ways to integrate <a href="https://www.mbdyn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MBDyn</a> for multi-body dynamics.</p><p>Ajinkya Dahale has a working prototype of a native custom data elements system, one that doesn’t require using 3rd party workbenches or abusing PropertyBag from the Path workbench (see our original research for an <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/build-system-for-custom-data-elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overview of available options</a>).</p><p>In conclusion, what we can say with absolute certainty is that, as a company, we feel that working on FreeCAD is fulfilling and rewarding. We hope that more companies creating FreeCAD-based products and services will join the development. There is no shortage of things to do and a lot to gain for everyone.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-you-can-contribute-to-v10-development">How you can contribute to v1.0 development<a href="#how-you-can-contribute-to-v10-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How you can contribute to v1.0 development" title="Direct link to How you can contribute to v1.0 development">​</a></h2><p>There are many ways users, developers, and companies which rely on FreeCAD can help make the next phase possible: </p><ul><li>You can <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/#donations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">donate</a> to the FreeCAD project association. Funds will be spent on getting grants to developers who improve the software and its ecosystem.</li><li>If you are a developer in the Vancouver area, interested in making FreeCAD better, please come to the <a href="https://blog.freecad.org/2023/05/24/freecad-hackathon-11-13-august-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hackathon</a> that is taking place on August 11-13.</li><li>There’s always a lot of work to moderate discussions in the community, translate and test the program, write documentation, and make video tutorials. Here is an <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Help_FreeCAD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduction</a> for people who can provide non-programming help.</li></ul><p>Finally, if you are a company that uses FreeCAD, you can join the community. Much of FreeCAD’s progress until now has been made by individuals. Commercial users are becoming increasingly important. Their needs and expertise will drive the next phase of development even faster.</p><p>At Ondsel, we  would be excited to talk to you and better understand what problems and frustrations you have with the software.

Since then, we’ve made a lot of progress, but even more work is yet to be done.</p><p>In this post, we’d like to explain how we are separating this work into stages, why FreeCAD 0.21 is not going to be much different from previous releases in terms of toponaming, and what our plan for the next development cycle is.</p><p>While this progress is cause to celebrate, we also caution users to understand that models can (and will) break for reasons besides toponaming even after this project is done.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-this-toponaming-thing-anyway">What’s this toponaming thing anyway?<a href="#whats-this-toponaming-thing-anyway" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s this toponaming thing anyway?" title="Direct link to What’s this toponaming thing anyway?">​</a></h2><p>As models evolve, their geometry changes. Doing a boolean sum of the same object with a different object will create new faces and vertices. So if a feature is attached to an element that no longer exists, the model will break. Topological naming is a way to store all element names in a persistent manner to avoid that scenario. You can read a much more detailed explanation in the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-topological-naming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</a>. The important thing here is that making topology names persistent implies changing FreeCAD’s source code in many places and the changes are not trivial. This is not a fix you can do on a lazy Sunday afternoon.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-tnp-team">The TNP team<a href="#the-tnp-team" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The TNP team" title="Direct link to The TNP team">​</a></h2><p>Before we go any further, let&#x27;s introduce the team that has been working on the fix all year so far.</p><p>John Dupuy is an Ondsel employee. He’s project coordinator, does code review, as well as his own share of programming.</p><p>Chris Hennes is FreeCAD maintainer who also writes code and does code review from other contributors. He did a large part of programming in phases 1 and 2 of the TNP fix (more on that below).</p><p>Pesc0 is a new arrival to FreeCAD. When the call for participation at fixing the TNP issue was posted, he picked a few tasks he was interested in, started hacking and — most importantly — didn’t drop the ball. He also turned out to be really great at communication with the team.</p><p>Zheng Lei aka RealThunder (or RT) developed the fix for the toponaming issue in his fork of FreeCAD. His patchset made it possible for the upstream team to study the issue in much more detail, explore possible solutions, and come up with a roadmap. The TNP team uses a lot of his code and the classes he developed. RealThunder was involved in a consulting role and provided some really useful insight.</p><p>Ajinkya Dahale is an active contributor to the project, and employee at Ondsel. His involvement so far is creating the fix for sketch objects.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="staging-the-fix">Staging the fix<a href="#staging-the-fix" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Staging the fix" title="Direct link to Staging the fix">​</a></h2><p>After studying the issue and the existing fix in RealThunder’s fork, we came up with a plan to introduce topological naming in five phases.</p><p>Phase 1: To begin, we need a way to store and manipulate short references names of elements and names serialized from the element mapping. We also need a way to handle element naming as a whole and store all descriptive elements in one place for easy reference. So this is where we wrote several classes — <code>IndexedName.cpp</code> (save the name of an element), <code>MappedName.cs</code> (store and manipulate the more-complex mapped-name used by elements and the toponaming algorithm), <code>MappedElement.cpp</code> class (save the name parts of an element), <code>ElementMap.h</code> (store all descriptive elements in one place for easy reference).</p><p>Phase 2: The main objective of this phase is to create a way to generatively express the history of an item, create new names and mappings, but not actually rely on them. This phase mainly touches Sketch and Part workbenches.</p><p>This is where we are now. Version 0.21 is coming out soon with stage 1 and stage 2 implemented. Some smaller items remain to be completed.</p><p>Phase 3: This is where we will start applying new names and mappings to geometry elements. We expect that at this point, until optimizations are done, FreeCAD will become somewhat slower. This expected performance regression is one of the main reasons we are not waiting for the entire work to be done to release a new FreeCAD version.</p><p>Phase 4: At this stage, we are planning to start using the new names when recalculating objects in all workbenches.</p><p>Phase 5: This final stage is where we do all the optimization to make FreeCAD fast and snappy while toponaming-safe.</p><p>The plan is to do phases 3 through 5 in the next development cycle leading up to releasing v1.0 some time next year.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="will-toponaming-solve-all-the-problems-with-models-breaking-nope">Will toponaming solve all the problems with models breaking? Nope.<a href="#will-toponaming-solve-all-the-problems-with-models-breaking-nope" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Will toponaming solve all the problems with models breaking? Nope." title="Direct link to Will toponaming solve all the problems with models breaking? Nope.">​</a></h2><p>There are multiple other opportunities for models to break even when toponaming is not involved. A common reason for that is using relative rather than absolute references when constraining elements of sketches. With relative references, FreeCAD will likely try to solve constraints in a different order, which will change geometry.</p><p>A certain combination of parameters can cause inversion of a part of a sketch. So when you e.g. change a parameter driven via spreadsheet, it will break your model forever, and you won&#x27;t be able to undo and/or recompute.</p><p>FreeCAD also does no validation of user input by itself. It will obediently do whatever the user asks it to do, even if it makes the model explode. This can be worked around by using conditional expressions to normalize user-submitted values that don&#x27;t make sense.</p><p>Brodie Fairhall covered these and a few other cases in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp6cIMA7LsI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> for FreeCAD User Conference 2023. We highly recommend watching it!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-work-on-the-tnp-fix-changed-the-project">How work on the TNP fix changed the project<a href="#how-work-on-the-tnp-fix-changed-the-project" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How work on the TNP fix changed the project" title="Direct link to How work on the TNP fix changed the project">​</a></h2><p>As a developers community, we’ve already made complex changes to FreeCAD in the past, like switching from Python 2.7 to Python 3, or porting the user interface from Qt 4 to Qt5. But the way we planned that work wasn’t great. Fixing the toponaming issue rivals past challenging projects in virtually every aspect, so it was time to change our approach to planning our work.
To do that, we decided to use GitHub’s projects feature, break the entire project into phases, and, most importantly, avoid trying to complete the entire project within one development cycle.</p><p>Another major change was making unit tests the norm. Until fairly recently, FreeCAD had zero unit tests. It was really bad, because it made discovering and fixing regressions quite a bit of a nightmare. Some work on that had started shortly before our work on TNP began, but we made it the rule that all new code should come with unit tests.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-conclusion">In conclusion<a href="#in-conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to In conclusion" title="Direct link to In conclusion">​</a></h2><p>Seeing a new contributor pick up rather complex tasks and work on them until the job is done has been one of the most rewarding experiences in this project so far. We would definitely appreciate more people following in the footsteps of Pesc0.</p><p>Here is what you can do. Most of the project conversation is taking place in a <a href="https://t.me/toponamingchat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated Telegram group</a>. The group has be-weekly teleconferences discussing progress and issues. The task list is discussed and built in <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/8432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub issue 8432</a> and new issues are made for each task. You can volunteer for one of those, create a PR, copy in the code from the toponaming branch, then start writing tests to build your understanding of what the code is doing, and iteratively accomplish the task.</p><p>This isn’t the easiest project to accomplish, and as FreeCAD v1.0 release is directly dependent on finalizing the toponaming fix, we encourage all interested developers to join us!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad/">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/development/">development</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog/"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer Entries</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/3/"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer bg-transparent footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col flex footer-layout"><div><div class="footer__title">Contact Us</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="mailto:contact@ondsel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">contact@ondsel.com<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ondsel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">facebook<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://x.com/ondsel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item" title="Follow us on X"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="18px"><g><path fill="white" d="M18.244 2.25h3.308l-7.227 8.26 8.502 11.24H16.17l-5.214-6.817L4.99 21.75H1.68l7.73-8.835L1.254 2.25H8.08l4.713 6.231zm-1.161 17.52h1.833L7.084 4.126H5.117z"></path></g></svg><svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_node_modules-@docusaurus-theme-classic-lib-theme-Icon-ExternalLink-styles-module" style="vertical-align: text-top;"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="col footer__col flex footer-layout"><div><div class="footer__title">Legal</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/tos/">Terms of Service</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="col footer__col flex footer-layout"><div><div class="footer__title">FreeCAD</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://freecad.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Website<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="footer__bottom copy_right text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 Ondsel, Inc.</div></div></div></footer></div>
