        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After operating for almost two years, Ondsel has made the difficult decision to cease operations and close down. We are incredibly thankful for the support we’ve received from the FreeCAD community and the larger engineering CAD communities.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-ondsel-is-closing-down">Why Ondsel is closing down<a href="#why-ondsel-is-closing-down" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Ondsel is closing down" title="Direct link to Why Ondsel is closing down">​</a></h2><p>From the beginning, we knew competing with commercial CAD would be tough. Closed-source CAD is taught in schools and is deeply entrenched in established industry use. We knew that to be successful, we would have to find a way to provide real value and coexist in environments where other tools are already used.</p><p>While seeking a scalable and repeatable business model, we conducted numerous surveys and interviewed nearly a hundred mechanical engineers, service engineers, tinkerers, inventors, workshop owners, and other users. While we found support among independent and hobbyist users who genuinely wanted us to succeed, we failed to find commercial adoption to justify a venture-capitalized startup. Ultimately, we could not find a product-market fit and ran out of runway to continue the search.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="things-we-are-proud-of">Things we are proud of<a href="#things-we-are-proud-of" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Things we are proud of" title="Direct link to Things we are proud of">​</a></h2><p>While we have failed to build a sustainable commercial business around FreeCAD, we have accomplished many things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-better-freecad-application">A better FreeCAD application<a href="#a-better-freecad-application" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A better FreeCAD application" title="Direct link to A better FreeCAD application">​</a></h3><ul><li>We contributed a new integrated assembly workbench that was sorely missing in the program and a 3D constraints solver on which the workbench relies.</li><li>We also contributed significant improvements to the usability of Sketcher and TechDraw.</li><li>We introduced VarSets — a brand-new custom properties system.</li><li>We introduced new features to TechDraw and CAM workbenches.</li><li>Beyond FreeCAD itself, we contributed to third-party addons like SheetMetal.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lens-as-a-service-for-connected-cad">Lens as a service for connected CAD<a href="#lens-as-a-service-for-connected-cad" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lens as a service for connected CAD" title="Direct link to Lens as a service for connected CAD">​</a></h3><ul><li>We demonstrated what a connected CAD experience could look like with open source at its core.</li><li>We built a service that enabled teams to organize iterated development of hardware products.</li><li>We built a simple way to share your models publicly or privately, including PIN protection for share links.</li><li>We made it possible to publish parametric models online that you can modify and download.</li></ul><p>Between our May release (2024.2) and today alone, 145 pull requests by the Ondsel team have been merged into the upstream codebase, making FreeCAD 1.0 a more featureful and polished release than we all hoped it would be.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-relationship-with-the-freecad-community">Our relationship with the FreeCAD community<a href="#our-relationship-with-the-freecad-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our relationship with the FreeCAD community" title="Direct link to Our relationship with the FreeCAD community">​</a></h3><p>Having a commercial partner working on FreeCAD also meant that the project had to adapt. Our presence and cooperation affected how the FreeCAD project operates. Our blog brought attention to missing features and helped the project establish priorities. Working with the core maintainers, we improved the contribution process, sped up the merge process, and helped form the Design Working Group and the new CAD Advisory Group. These are significant advances that will benefit the community for a long time.  </p><p>Most of all, we showed that a commercial partner can be an asset to the project. We hope many more entrepreneurs will build around FreeCAD in the spirit of cooperation to establish a robust ecosystem that benefits the world and is profitable. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-happens-to-ondsel-es">What happens to Ondsel ES<a href="#what-happens-to-ondsel-es" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What happens to Ondsel ES" title="Direct link to What happens to Ondsel ES">​</a></h2><p>OES was designed to be our flavor of FreeCAD with more pleasing UX/UI, frequent releases, and added value.</p><p>Part of the better UX/UI was our improvements to Sketcher and TechDraw—all users of FreeCAD 1.0 will enjoy those. We owe much of the praise for the UI to Joe Sardos, who designed OpenTheme. We didn’t fund that project, but we pushed it on our users, and they loved it. So we think Joe did a spectacular job, and we cannot thank him enough for that. </p><p>The added value we shipped as part of OES is all available as free and open-source code, and most of it will be part of FreeCAD.</p><p>As such, there is no point in releasing v2024.3. However, we are not abandoning the FreeCAD community. Brad will continue hacking in the CAM workbench, Pierre will likely continue working on Assembly and Sketcher, and Pieter will keep working on varsets and variant parts thanks to grants issued by the FreeCAD Project Association. All future contributions to FreeCAD by our former team members will now go directly to the upstream project.</p><p>We have yet to submit a few improvements to FreeCAD, namely the reloadable objects feature, which we strongly believe should be a core feature. We will submit this as a PR to upstream.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-happens-to-the-user-base">What happens to the user base<a href="#what-happens-to-the-user-base" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What happens to the user base" title="Direct link to What happens to the user base">​</a></h2><p>We will notify customers and users of the shutdown. The server will continue running for a reasonable period to give users time to download their data. If you have any projects on Lens that you haven’t backed up anywhere else, please download them as soon as possible.</p><p>Paying customers will be reimbursed for any remaining time on their subscription.</p><p>For questions or comments please email us at <a href="mailto:support@ondsel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support@ondsel.com</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2024-10-22T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's make it easy to connect CAD software via STEP files]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>STEP files are the lingua franca for the CAD world. Virtually every solid modeling tool is capable of exporting STEP. Most can also import these files, but the experience can vary wildly in practice. Import may be possible but clunky. It may require the user to choose from many confusing options. Depending on how the file was exported, import may just fail. </p><p>The OpenCASCADE kernel on which Ondsel is based handles STEP files remarkably well. It can load files that cause commercial tools like SolidWorks to crash. However, the user experience is still unfriendly when you work on a project where files in this format need to be linked rather than imported.</p><p>The Lens addon coming in the next release of Ondsel ES is featuring reloadable STEP files — a simple way to link STEP files in your project so that Ondsel ES could become a better player in workflows that involve various other CAD and EDA tools.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-reloadable-file">What is a reloadable file?<a href="#what-is-a-reloadable-file" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is a reloadable file?" title="Direct link to What is a reloadable file?">​</a></h2><p>A reloadable is a simple wrapper of an imported file. The wrapper tracks where the file came from and can reload it on demand. That doesn’t sound like much but let’s look at a common problem to see why this is important.</p><p>Imagine that you have a STEP file that you’ve downloaded from the web and you want to use Ondsel’s CAM workbench to manufacture a physical copy.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Load a STEP file for CNC" src="/assets/images/load-for-cnc-614e99f297f478ec920a6b3e2ef112b9.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Your workflow would look something like this:</p><ol><li>Create a new document and import the file.</li><li>Create a CAM job: set up the part, stock, and tools.</li><li>Create the operations to machine the part.</li><li>Post-process and run the job.</li></ol><p>Now imagine what happens when you realize that you have downloaded and imported an old revision of the part. Most of that work is wasted and you have to start over.</p><p>With a reloadable, the workflow looks similar:</p><ol><li>Create a new document.</li><li>Insert a reloadable via <code>File &gt; Add Reloadable Object</code> and set the path to the STEP file. The part appears.</li><li>Select the reloadable object and create the CAM job like before.</li><li>Create the operations.</li><li>Post-process and run the job.</li></ol><p>Now when you find that there’s a better revision, you simply download the new one. Double-click on the reloadable and either select the new file or, if you overwrote it on download, press ‘Apply’. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Reload a STEP file" src="/assets/images/reload-step-file-25c5c1420f24bb31189a07218736abf8.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The new version is imported into the reloadable and the shape is updated. The CAM job and operations still refer to the reloadable wrapper and don’t need to change at all. Just post-process again and you’re ready to run.</p><p>The same thing happens within TechDraw, Assembly, and many other workbenches.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="functionality-benefits-and-limitations">Functionality, benefits, and limitations<a href="#functionality-benefits-and-limitations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Functionality, benefits, and limitations" title="Direct link to Functionality, benefits, and limitations">​</a></h2><p>The reloadable can load files from the local file system or from any URL that serves a STEP file directly. For example, if the STEP file is in a GitHub repo, you can get the URL from the ‘raw’ link. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Link to a raw file on GitHub" src="/assets/images/link-to-raw-file-on-github-ef7fe8b039963263cb6e9cd602c7b2f9.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Or if someone uploaded a STEP file on Lens and create a public share link for it, you can insert it too: start adding a reloadable file, switch to URL as a source, then paste a share link URL for your STEP file into the entry box, and click ‘Apply’:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Reloadable share link" src="/assets/images/reloadable-share-link-6bae5df854c491d220e7ca8931714611.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The trick is to make share links that always point to the latest version. Otherwise you'd have to insert a new share link for a new revision.</p><p>If the wrapper points to a file on the local filesystem, it will detect if the file on the disk is newer than the imported version. The icon will change to indicate a reload is possible (the one for ‘Widget3‘ on the screenshot below).</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="screenshot of the project tree with a different icon on the reloadable" src="/assets/images/object-is-reloadable-0237bb586711f965bfe63666741ad508.webp" width="1244" height="677" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It won’t automatically reload though. To reload, just double-click and press ‘Apply’.</p><p>The imported shape will behave like any other shape. You can select vertices, edges, and faces and use them wherever you would use a native shape. But be warned: if the reloaded shapes have different faces and edges, any references you have built to them will break. This isn’t, and cannot be, solved by the toponaming mitigation that was recently completed. There’s simply no way for Ondsel to know how the geometry of the shape has changed. We strongly encourage you to use references to underlying geometry sparingly.</p><p>The reloadable wrapper is intended to wrap smaller single-body shapes. While it is capable of importing large compound STEP files with many sub-elements, they will be shown as a single shape and you’ll be unable to interact with the sub-elements.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-details-and-improvements">Technical details and improvements<a href="#technical-details-and-improvements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technical details and improvements" title="Direct link to Technical details and improvements">​</a></h2><p>We believe that making Ondsel ES work better with other design tools is important. We know you use many tools to get the job done and it should be as easy as possible to move between them. We intend to keep improving the reloadable with new features and improved performance. There are a couple of ideas we’re looking into:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Better workflow for using reloadables from Lens.</strong> Imagine being able to browse for a needed off-the-shelf part through the Ondsel addon, click on it, and have it immediately available inside your document as a reloadable object. It's already possible, but the workflow isn't great, we will improve it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make the reloadable wrapper also store the import preferences and settings.</strong> Different STEP files may need different import properties. Once chosen, these should apply on reload without your intervention.</p></li><li><p><strong>Allow the user to add additional coordinate systems (LCS) to the reloadable.</strong> These could be used as attachment points in an assembly and would avoid problems on reload, even if the base geometry changed. </p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="availability">Availability<a href="#availability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Availability" title="Direct link to Availability">​</a></h2><p>This feature is currently available in our weekly builds and will be part of Ondsel ES 2024.3 that is scheduled to coincide with the FreeCAD 1.0 release. We are interested in your feedback and ideas on how to further improve it. Please grab the latest weekly made, try it, and <a href="https://discord.gg/7jmzezyyfP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talk to us</a>!</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the upcoming new version of Ondsel ES, we are bringing major changes to the Lens addon.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the upcoming new version of Ondsel ES, we are bringing major changes to the Lens addon. Let’s outline our strategy here and do a quick preview of what’s coming.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-all-this-is-going">Where all this is going<a href="#where-all-this-is-going" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Where all this is going" title="Direct link to Where all this is going">​</a></h2><p>We think that the Lens integration is most useful when you can easily download and reuse parts from the online service right in the desktop application — whether we are talking about off-the-shelf components in the public section of the library or custom parts privately designed by your teammates.</p><p>This means three major changes must happen: </p><ol><li>The addon needs a different user interface, one that works better for browsing the entire catalog of components — the sidebar in 2024.2 is not great for that.</li><li>Search should be built right into the addon. You should be able to get the entire list of components available to you, preview them, and then open the ones you are interested in with just one click.</li><li>You should be able to pick a part from Ondsel Lens and link it into your assembly.</li></ol><p>We’ve already done 1 and 2, and laid a solid foundation for 3.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-coming-in-the-next-release">What’s coming in the next release<a href="#whats-coming-in-the-next-release" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s coming in the next release" title="Direct link to What’s coming in the next release">​</a></h2><p><strong>MDI view</strong>. When it comes to sidebars, users spend most of their time interacting with the project tree, the Property View panel, and the Task panel. We listened to your feedback and turned the Lens add-on panel into a window in the main view. So it gets out of your way when you design, but you can easily switch to it when you need to upload a revision or browse for a component. Just click on the Ondsel Lens tab at the bottom.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/ondsel-addon-2024-10-update-workspaces-8383763b8dcde91bc4391c12c8787e7f.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We also added three new tabs that bring previously unavailable functionality.</p><p><strong>Ondsel Start</strong>. This is where we provide example files to help you try new features, as well as promote great work that Lens users do.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/ondsel-addon-2024-10-update-start-page-dcc03134154429628509c373692ee164.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Search</strong>. It’s now possible to search for models (by share link names), users, workspaces, and organizations available on Lens. When you try to open a share link, you get to choose whether you want to open in Ondsel ES or on Lens in the browser.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/2024/lens-2024-10-update/search-in-lens-addon.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p><strong>Public Shares</strong>. The last new tab brings access to 25 latest publicly available models and parts, sorted from newest to oldest.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/ondsel-addon-2024-10-public-shares-3d091f49de34d98892ceaad385fbd223.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>More share link options</strong>. We updated the addon to bring it up to speed with Lens. You can now set protection options for a new share link: make it publicly listed, not listed at all, or not listed <em>and</em> PIN-protected.</p><p>You can also tell Lens how to handle versioning in the share link: it can always load the latest revision or the particular revision that this model was at when you created this share link. This option is only available when you create a new share link.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/ondsel-addon-2024-10-share-link-options-a3316e7228e03f28836a5b191d02784a.webp" width="988" height="1122" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Finally, you can now also set a private note. The title you set shows up in File Info and the public models feed, but private notes are only for yourself and your team.</p><p>When you create multiple share links for the same model, it’s typically because of one of the two reasons. You either want a share link per revision, or you want share links with different permissions for different people. So it’s useful to know the purpose of each share link. Private notes can tell you just that months and years later when you no longer remember the details, They are only visible to people who belong to the organization.</p><p><strong>Persistent connection</strong>. The addon now handles network connectivity issues gracefully and doesn’t log you out when you temporarily lose Internet access.</p><p><strong>Share link handling</strong>. You can now open a model from a share link directly in Ondsel ES when you are browsing Lens in a browser. The workflow is similar to what you get when e.g. clicking Zoom links. This works on both Linux, Windows, and macOS.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/2024/lens-2024-10-update/open-in-oes.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>The feature sounds like a minor thing, but it actually required both server-side changes and developing some rather unusual macOS-specific code (Windows and Linux implementations were comparatively trivial). </p><p><strong>Reloadable objects</strong>. You can link a STEP file directly now (“File &gt; Add Reloadable Object”), whether it’s located in a local folder on your computer or uploaded to a website (and you have a direct URL). When the linked file changes, Ondsel ES displays a different icon for the linked part that suggests you might want to reload that file. Just click the Recompute button in the toolbar.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/ondsel-addon-2024-10-reloadable-cd1ce8e6f87a5b24505f7769644b6dae.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We distribute this feature as part of the addon. There’s a separate post coming with details about how it all works. Suffice to say, we are not going to stop at STEP files, this is just the beginning. The plan is to make it easy to reuse off-the-shelf components from Lens, whatever supported file format they are in.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-you-can-test-it">How you can test it<a href="#how-you-can-test-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How you can test it" title="Direct link to How you can test it">​</a></h2><p>All these changes are now available in weekly builds available from the Pre-Releases section of the <a href="https://lens.ondsel.com/download-and-explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download and Explore</a> page. You can register (free tier gets you free downloads), download, and try it for yourself.</p><p>If this is the first time you are running Ondsel ES, you don’t need to do anything. However, if you installed and ran Ondsel ES at least once before, to get access to new features, you need to either delete the local copy of the plugin or change where its source is coming from. The latter requires having git installed on your system, so we’ll go the easy route that works everywhere:</p><ol><li>Quite Ondsel ES if you are running it.</li><li>Go to a local folder where your addons are:<ol><li>Windows: <code>C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\Ondsel\Mod\</code></li><li>macOS: <code>~/Library/Preferences/Ondsel/Mod/</code></li><li>Linux: <code>~/.local/share/Ondsel/Mod/</code></li></ol></li><li>Delete the <code>Ondsel-Lens</code> folder.</li><li>Start Ondsel ES, that’s all.</li></ol><p>Once v2024.3 is out alongside FreeCAD v1.0, you will need to repeat that again so that you would be using the latest stable code of the addon.</p><p>Please note that if you have a git client installed on your system, you should also be able to select the Ondsel Lens addon in the Addon Manager and then switch between git branches instead of deleting hidden folders.</p><p>We are not going to add a lot of new features between now and 2024.3, it's time to spend more time polishing the user experience. So we are interested in your feedback, you can post it on our <a href="https://discord.gg/7jmzezyyfP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while ago we collaborated with Libre Space Foundation on a fun little project that required simulating multi-body dynamics (MBD) in zero gravity. This helped us improve the MBD-capable solver that we’ve been developing behind the scenes for a while.

The foundation focuses on developing and promoting open-source hardware and software solutions for satellite missions and space exploration.</p><p>LSF works on a range of projects, including satellite communications, ground station networks, and educational initiatives that aim to democratize access to space.

It has already seen real action in 2022 when it deployed 6 cubesats during the <a href="https://everydayastronaut.com/flta002-to-the-black-alpha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first successful flight</a> of Firefly’s <a href="https://fireflyspace.com/alpha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpha</a> rocket.</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:1rem"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jprpUmrIjTs" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0"></iframe></div><p>PICOBUS has the following parts:</p><ul><li>The rail that CubeSats slide into.</li><li>The pusher that slides in the rail and holds the one end of the constant force spring.</li><li>Surrounding plates that hold pocketqubes in place.</li><li>The rocket mounting flange that attaches the deployer to the rocket.</li><li>The door that has the deployment mechanism, thermal knives, and electronics.</li></ul><p>So how does the deployment in space happen? The door is held shut by a spring-loaded pin, and that pin is held in place by a string. When signal is received from the rocket, two thermal knives are heated, and the string is cut. Once they are cut, the pin is pulled out, and the door is allowed to rotate. With the door open, the constant-force spring pushes CubeSats out, and they exit the deployer.</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:1rem"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bov6562iv1s" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0"></iframe></div><p>In fact, this FOSDEM 2024 talk discussed all this in great many detail:</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:1rem"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZOUvQp9r-P8" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0"></iframe></div><p>Here comes the interesting part. To better understand what happens when the satellites leave the deployer, the LSF team needed to know three things:</p><ol><li><strong>Dimensions of the exit cone</strong> that satellites form when they are pushed outside.</li><li><strong>Exit velocity</strong> of the satellites when they leave the deployer.</li><li><strong>Satellite tumbling</strong> upon exit, as the satellites are pushed from the bottom plate and have a tumbling momentum.</li></ol><p>The challenge here was that calculations needed to involve multi-body dynamics simulation as cubesats hit the rail, the surrounding plates, the door, and each other as they exit the deployer.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-team">The team<a href="#the-team" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The team" title="Direct link to The team">​</a></h2><p>On the LSF side, we worked with two core contributors to the project — Thanos Patsas and Manthos Papamatthaiou. On the Ondsel side, Dr. Aik-Siong Koh, principal developer of Ondsel Solver, did the majority of the consulting and the development of our own private solver with multi-body dynamics capabilities.</p><p>We also hired Jose Gabriel Egas Ortuño to do the actual simulation and improve the new version of his <a href="https://gitlab.com/josegegas/freecad-mbdyn-dynamics-workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-body dynamics workbench</a> that originally relied on <a href="https://www.mbdyn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MBDyn</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-we-did">What we did<a href="#what-we-did" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What we did" title="Direct link to What we did">​</a></h2><p>As Jose’s workbench originally used MBDyn, we needed to update OndselMbD (our own solver, currently private) to read MBDyn input files and generate its output files so that it could be an MBDyn replacement in certain scenarios. A major challenge here was MBDyn not having the concept of Marker objects which are required by OndselMbD —  an equivalent to local coordinate systems, that has methods to help with MBD calculations.</p><p>The Libre Space Foundation team provided us STEP models for almost all the parts involved. To make the assembly complete, Jose modeled a few more parts. The pusher was modeled using a constant-force spring which imposes an acceleration to the satellites once the door opens and deployment takes place. To open the door, a pre-loaded torsion spring was modeled which, once released, applied a torque to the door’s hinge, opening it. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Overall assembly" src="/assets/images/overall-assembly-ab4de9d23d6d309a8a9cadd586e55b47.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Then Jose modeled the contacts between the pusher, CubeSats, and the door. These contacts were modeled using a mass-spring-damper contact model, in which a spring-damper system is added between the parts that make contact together, and the spring and damping constants are adjusted to mimic the behavior of the real contact.</p><p>Here is the simulation video:</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/2024/lsf-feature/cubesats-deployment-simulation.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-to-expect-the-mission">When to expect the mission<a href="#when-to-expect-the-mission" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When to expect the mission" title="Direct link to When to expect the mission">​</a></h2><p>The Libre Space Foundation team is currently waiting for the launch date — some time next year.

In particular, the engine doesn't have the concept of markers — coordinate system objects on parts. You could apply forces and torques on them, use them to form joints and prescribed motions, take measurements between them and read their positions, velocities and accelerations. This is being discussed. We are also developing some prerequisites for markers in the core of Ondsel ES and FreeCAD.</p><p>On a purely emotional level, it’s overwhelming to see someone using free and open-source software to design something that gets to fly into space and then do the job it was designed to do. The Libre Space Foundation made that a reality, several times already.</p><p>This collaboration and research around that also made us realize how much underappreciated the entire field of multi-body dynamics is. The industry-grade tools are expensive and very hard to master, but the results are extremely desirable. Unlocking MBD for more people is worth doing, but this means the tools have to be democratized — not just in price, but also in UX/UI. And there are some serious compromises to achieve here to make this work for both professionals and beginners.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Laser cutters are a staple in maker spaces and are often the first exposure users have to CNC equipment. They are fast and accurate. They produce usable parts from inexpensive materials. They can cut and engrave and are intuitive to use. </p><p>However, laser cutters typically have a different workflow compared to other CNC machines. Instead of G-code, the input for laser cutters is usually 2D geometry files such as SVG, DXF, or image files. The control software then automatically generates the G-code internally. This means that users need to prepare their SVG files before feeding them to laser cutters, and the procedure is different for every cutter.</p><p>To make things easier, we developed a post-processor for the CAM workbench that generates SVG files automatically. It helps streamline the workflow and cuts down the time it usually takes to go from design to product.</p><p>SVG isn’t intended for machine control. Using it for that purpose is convenient but introduces some problems that the user needs to resolve. Let’s take a look at them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="typical-challenges">Typical challenges<a href="#typical-challenges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Typical challenges" title="Direct link to Typical challenges">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="offsetting">Offsetting<a href="#offsetting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Offsetting" title="Direct link to Offsetting">​</a></h3><p>With an SVG, the geometry describes the desired part. If we push the laser beam along that line, the kerf (material removed by the laser) will be divided on either side and the final part will be slightly smaller than designed. Interior holes will be slightly larger. Laser cutter beams are usually very narrow and, for some applications, the user can simply ignore the kerf. But if the user wants highly accurate parts, the SVG has to be scaled up or down to account for it.</p><p>CAM tools like FreeCAD’s CAM workbench handle kerf automatically. They offset the toolpath from the part model by the radius of the cutter. The resulting parts and holes are accurately cut. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="feed-rate-and-laser-power">Feed Rate and Laser Power<a href="#feed-rate-and-laser-power" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Feed Rate and Laser Power" title="Direct link to Feed Rate and Laser Power">​</a></h3><p>In CAM tools, controlling the feed rate and the spindle speed is done with explicit G-code commands. SVG and DXF files don’t have such commands so the desired feed rate and laser power settings are implied through layers and colors. The user makes certain lines red and other lines blue. The laser control is then configured to interpret a red line as a cutting line and runs the laser at a pre-specified feed rate and power level. There’s no universal standard for these colors. Some laser cutters ignore color entirely and instead use different layers of the SVG file to correspond to different operations. It falls on the user to know what the laser controller needs and to carefully create the image accordingly.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="part-placement">Part Placement<a href="#part-placement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Part Placement" title="Direct link to Part Placement">​</a></h3><p>The ideal position of a part for fabrication is seldom the same as the ideal position for modeling. Consider a simple box where the user has designed cut pieces to fit together. The assembly position is radically different from the cut -sheet. CAM tools allow for creating cut sheets and optimizing the cut layout without disturbing the original assembly.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Assembly cut sheet" src="/assets/images/assembly-cut-sheet-5bfcb444221438ba5a95a9f49818030d.webp" width="1351" height="719" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="multiple-passes">Multiple Passes<a href="#multiple-passes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Multiple Passes" title="Direct link to Multiple Passes">​</a></h3><p>There are times when the user wants the laser to follow the same pass multiple times. Cutting through particularly thick material is one. With an SVG file, this is done by having multiple identical edges. It works but is impossible for a human to see and verify. With CAM, passes are shown as distinct tool paths. As long as the Z-depth value is different, the user can see them.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Step downs and offsets" src="/assets/images/stepdowns-and-offsets-23a564005982e3a3b5a86acbda44b3ea.webp" width="1060" height="934" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Unfortunately, CAM tools usually produce G-code. Wouldn’t it be nice if the user could set up a traditional CAM job, lay out the parts the way they want for cutting, configure the feed rate and power, and then automatically produce an SVG file that the laser cutter could read?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="existing-solutions">Existing solutions<a href="#existing-solutions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Existing solutions" title="Direct link to Existing solutions">​</a></h2><p>The <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-macros/blob/master/TechDraw/LasercutterSVGExport.FCMacro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LasercutterSVGExport</a> macro available in the FreeCAD Addon Manager is one solution that a lot of people turn to. It works well but still requires repositioning the parts for cutting on a TechDraw page.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ondsel-svg-postprocessor">Ondsel SVG Postprocessor<a href="#ondsel-svg-postprocessor" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ondsel SVG Postprocessor" title="Direct link to Ondsel SVG Postprocessor">​</a></h2><p>To simplify working with laser cutters while leveraging the regular CNC workflow, we’ve developed a new SVG-specific postprocessor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dimensioning and tolerancing should be a first class citizen in modern 3D CAD software]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many people in the Ondsel/FreeCAD community started out as hobbyists and eventually turned their passion into a business. A common story we hear is the frustration they faced getting real-world parts made from their digital designs. It’s understandable. For many people, their first experience of fabrication is the 3D printer. You design the part, push a button, and get your part.  It’s easy, right? Except that hole that you designed to fit a bolt is just a little too small or the tab that should fit into the slot is a little too tight and breaks the part when you force it.</p><p>What these users experienced was their first taste of <em>tolerance</em>. While the design may be perfect, the real-world manufacturing process never is. The part is only as perfect as the manufacturing process permits. </p><p>Modern manufacturing processes can achieve impressive dimensional accuracy but it comes at a cost. The closer you want the part to conform to the designed dimensions, the more expensive the manufacturing process is.</p><p>Experienced designers and engineers know this. They design the parts to have tight tolerance requirements only when strictly necessary. More importantly, they communicate those requirements to the manufacturer explicitly because neglecting to specify them means the requirement is ambiguous. You may pay too much for the part or you might get a part that doesn’t work.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="GD&amp;amp;T example" src="/assets/images/gdt-example-662ef53f2599a137104e21b0b68a6e31.webp" width="820" height="425" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Traditionally, tolerance requirements were captured in the technical drawings, such as the one on the illustration above. As CAD matures, these requirements are being captured in the design itself and that is called Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T) — a set of rules that communicate the intent behind design and what tolerances are acceptable.</p><p>Let’s discuss what GD&amp;T is and what it isn’t, what’s currently available in FreeCAD to support this standard, how the program currently stacks against competition with regards to GD&amp;T, and what we think the plan forward should be.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-basics-of-gdt">The basics of GD&amp;T<a href="#the-basics-of-gdt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The basics of GD&amp;T" title="Direct link to The basics of GD&amp;T">​</a></h2><p>Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing works by attaching constraints to features of a part. These constraints communicate the acceptable deviation in form, size, orientation and location of the feature and are displayed with a set of standardized symbols which can be shown on screen or depicted in a technical drawing. </p><p>The key symbols in GD&amp;T fall into five categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Form Control</strong>: this includes symbols like flatness, straightness, circularity, and cylindricity, which ensure that the shape of the part meets specific requirements.</li><li><strong>Profile Control</strong>: profile of a surface and profile of a line are used to control the shape of a feature and ensure it fits within the specified tolerance zone.</li><li><strong>Orientation Control</strong>: symbols like parallelism, perpendicularity, and angularity define the orientation of features relative to each other.</li><li><strong>Location Control</strong>: this includes position, concentricity, and symmetry symbols, which ensure that features are located in the correct place on the part.</li><li><strong>Runout Control</strong>: circular and total runout control the roundness and surface rotation of cylindrical parts.</li></ul><p>There are also modifiers such as <strong>Maximum Material Condition</strong> and <strong>Least Material Condition</strong> that describe the condition of a part when it contains the most or the least material possible within its specified tolerance limits. They are commonly used with the true position symbol applied to the diameter of a pin or a hole.</p><p>This video works as a very good introduction to the topic:</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:1rem"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G7wnGeR_69k" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0"></iframe></div><p>If you want to take an even deeper dive, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GeoTolPro/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GeoTol channel on YouTube</a> provides very useful information that is not tied to a specific CAD.</p><p>While we specifically refer to ASME GD&amp;T in this post, this is not the only standard that deals with dimensioning and tolerancing, as well as with the use of gauges, acceptance testing etc.</p><p>Another common option is ISO’s Geometrical Product Specifications. GD&amp;T and GPS have an overlapping scope and a few fundamentals differences (you can use <a href="https://www.gdandtbasics.com/iso-vs-asme-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this guide</a> for reference). The two standards also use different terminology for the same tolerances and <em>mostly</em> the same symbols. In the future, it would be useful to provide means to work in either GD&amp;T or in ISO-GPS context.</p><p>From users’ perspective, any GD&amp;T implementation should allow doing three things: attaching tolerance constraints to features, displaying them on the screen on a 2D drawing, importing and exporting GD&amp;T data from and to STEP files. Let’s see what’s available in FreeCAD.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="attaching-tolerances-to-features">Attaching tolerances to features<a href="#attaching-tolerances-to-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Attaching tolerances to features" title="Direct link to Attaching tolerances to features">​</a></h2><p>This is currently implemented in a 3rd-party workbench called FreeCAD-GDT. The workbench was <a href="https://github.com/juanvanyo/FreeCAD-GDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">originally</a> developed by Juan Vañó Cerdá, but the most recent work was done in a <a href="https://github.com/5axes/FreeCAD-GDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fork by 5axes</a>, so that’s what we are looking at here.</p><p>Juan intended the workbench to cover GD&amp;T use in both 2D and 3D, but so far the existing feature set is 3D-only. There isn’t much documentation available on the workbench, nor are there any YouTube videos. The only explainer is <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=171564#p171564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the forum</a>.</p><p>The general workflow is this: create an annotation plane, then create a datum reference or a geometric tolerance, set its properties, and then point where you want it placed.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="GDT workbench" src="/assets/images/freecad-gdt-wb-new-tolerance-25c0c290afd8d2416311f28d5250a15e.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Overall, while the workbench provides an initial implementation of GD&amp;T, there are several things that need attention: incomplete coverage of the standard (e.g. material modifiers don't seem to be implemented), no way to export annotations along with STEP data, and a number of UX issues including broken undo/redo. At the moment, the workbench doesn't even render data correctly inside control frames.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Incorrect label placement" src="/assets/images/freecad-gdt-placed-wrongly-7eb9e0017bac74faa686418b2c457c0d.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It's obvious though that the feature is all but trivial, so it's supposed to take time and effort to complete it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="support-for-gdt-data-in-the-step-loadersaver">Support for GD&amp;T data in the STEP loader/saver<a href="#support-for-gdt-data-in-the-step-loadersaver" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Support for GD&amp;T data in the STEP loader/saver" title="Direct link to Support for GD&amp;T data in the STEP loader/saver">​</a></h2><p>There are multiple reasons why you would want this.</p><p>First and foremost, you do want that for metrology. When engineers do the inspection, they need reference data to compare the measured data against what’s within the acceptable range of values and what’s out of the range. They can enter that reference information manually or they can load it from a STEP file. Since you create the annotations anyway, why not save them into STEP as well?</p><p>Secondly, there is this blasphemous thought that a model that is 100% defined can replace 2D drawings. If you collaborate on projects with people who used other CAD software, STEP is likely the file format you use. Besides, as 2D drawings are prone to misinterpretations, you likely want to submit STEP files to your manufacturer to clear any possible confusions.</p><p>Currently, the most up-to-date version of STEP that supports GD&amp;T annotations is <a href="http://www.ap242.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AP242</a>. FreeCAD / Ondsel ES can export that, but the code needs to be enhanced to include GD&amp;T data. The same applies to the loading of STEP files.</p><p>The obvious prerequisite for loading and saving GD&amp;T data from/to STEP files is being able to store this information natively in FreeCAD files. It isn’t currently supported.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="displaying-annotations-on-techdraw-pages">Displaying annotations on TechDraw pages<a href="#displaying-annotations-on-techdraw-pages" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Displaying annotations on TechDraw pages" title="Direct link to Displaying annotations on TechDraw pages">​</a></h2><p>You can create GD&amp;T annotations in 2D drawings with TechDraw. However, the workflow is not amazing:</p><ol><li>Add a view of a part.</li><li>Use the Balloon tool to add a balloon to a geometry feature.</li><li>Change the balloon’s settings to use a rectangular frame.</li><li>Use a different tool to construct balloon's label from presets.</li><li>Copy/paste that label into the balloon's text box.</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Hacking up GD&amp;amp;T frames in TechDraw" src="/assets/images/techdraw-gdt-frames-828bb37486b8113331f0247df01548b9.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This is covered in the following video tutorial by MangoJelly:</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:1rem"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7GwaIpJgp1Q" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0"></iframe></div><p>The workflow assumes a lot of manual work — more than what you get in some of the proprietary tools. If you do your dimensioning in Sketcher (and you likely do that), you can’t use that information in TechDraw, you have to use the Smart Dimension tool in TechDraw to attach dimensions to views again. And when you add GD&amp;T annotations, you have to manually place all that information next to each other, as there is no automatic alignment and grouping.</p><p>Moreover, even after manual work annotations are not great visually, as is evident from the screenshot above. The centering of labels inside frames is not correct (you have to use whitespaces to make it better), datum features are attached to geometric features in a strange way etc.</p><p>Suffices to say that even WandererFan who is the principal developer and maintainer of TechDraw is <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=594813#p594813" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not very fond</a> of this:</p><blockquote><p>I'm not in favour of hacking balloons to better simulate Feature Control Frames. I would much rather introduce a dedicated function.</p></blockquote><p>The competition is currently one step ahead. E.g. in SolidWorks you do the dimensioning when sketching, then you can bring those dimensions into a view on a drawing page with literally just one click. After that you can attach the GD&amp;T data to an existing dimension, and once you do that, all the metadata will be combined, and you can reposition it all without doing a multiselection.</p><p>The problem here is that getting geometry information to create dimensions seems to be impossible in FreeCAD at the moment. All the dimensioning you do in TechDraw happens on views rather than on the original geometry. The most obvious case where it breaks are axonometric views: TechDraw will never get dimensions right, because it has no concept of original geometry in perspective.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Wrong dimensions in perspective" src="/assets/images/techdraw-gdt-wrong-dimensions-de500cea29565dafc92157c9c21cf166.webp" width="1322" height="744" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This larger issue has been discussed in <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/12383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this issue report</a>. So that likely needs to be fixed first.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-we-think-should-be-done">What we think should be done<a href="#what-we-think-should-be-done" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What we think should be done" title="Direct link to What we think should be done">​</a></h2><p>Let’s zoom out a little here. GD&amp;T is essentially a kind of metadata. The main friction with all metadata is that it’s typically designed as an afterthought. You do something, then <em>maybe</em> you add metadata. And much of that is manual work.</p><p>Right now, if you want GD&amp;T annotations both in 3D view and on TechDraw pages, you have to do the dimensioning three times:</p><ol><li>When you sketch your part</li><li>When you create GD&amp;T annotations in the FreeCAD-GDT workbench</li><li>When you add the same annotations to views in TechDraw</li></ol><p>But what if FreeCAD was capable enough to automatically or semi-automatically capture much of the data as you design a part?</p><p>When you constraint the length in Sketcher, can it automatically add GD&amp;T metadata that can be updated with limits immediately or later on?</p><p>When you create a circular pocket in Part Design, can it give you an option to automatically add cylindricity?</p><p>In that case you wouldn’t be starting from scratch when annotating, you would likely have to do some refining and add missing properties.</p><p>The first step in designing such a system should be updating the file format to allow storing GD&amp;T metadata so that the program had somewhere to store the captured data in.</p><p>Once that is done, it’s possible to implement some basic capturing of the GD&amp;T data. Then you can start adding GD&amp;T visualization, as well as manipulation tools to refine captured data and add more annotations.</p><p>Finally, once <em>that</em> is done, and users have full control over annotations, STEP loading and exporting code can be updated to match the existing feature set.</p><p>We can (and likely <em>should</em>) argue on implementation details, but let's agree on the general proposal first.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-the-next-step-should-be">What the next step should be<a href="#what-the-next-step-should-be" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What the next step should be" title="Direct link to What the next step should be">​</a></h2><p>While maintainers are busy getting FreeCAD 1.0 out the door, let’s discuss the plan and flesh it out so that real work could start. There's a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated GitHub board</a>, but right now it only has one issue card related to inefficient GD&amp;T workflow in the TechDraw workbench. Let’s use it to plan further work.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can use your Lens account to easily save and restore your own Ondsel ES defaults. Or make the same defaults for an entire team.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, we shipped Ondsel ES 2024.2 with a small nifty feature: backing up your entire Ondsel ES preferences to Lens and then restoring them. Here is a quick guide on how to do that.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-why">The “Why”<a href="#the-why" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The “Why”" title="Direct link to The “Why”">​</a></h2><p>There are two main reasons why you might want to do it.</p><p>As Ondsel ES is based on FreeCAD, it inherits the ultimate configurability of the original application. But it also means that sometimes customization experiments can go wrong and you might want to revert to defaults. However, since Ondsel ES builds on top of FreeCAD, reverting to defaults means you are getting the default FreeCAD look and settings, which isn’t necessarily a desirable thing.</p><p>Secondly, if you customized Ondsel ES just the way you want it and you need to apply the same settings across multiple computers, you might want an easy way to do that — one that doesn’t involve emailing yourself or your teammates a <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Preference_Packs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preferences pack</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-how">The “How”<a href="#the-how" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The “How”" title="Direct link to The “How”">​</a></h2><p>To <strong>revert to personal Ondsel defaults</strong>, all you need to do is go to the Lens panel, log in, right-click on the “Default (Personal)” workspace and select “Download preferences for Personal”. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Download for Personal" src="/assets/images/backup-prefs-download-for-personal-19341d9eb0d301eaded1073938014bf1.webp" width="1216" height="1120" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Ondsel ES will apply changes and ask whether you want to restart now or later to see the defaults in action. This is pretty much it.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Restart warning" src="/assets/images/backup-prefs-restart-warning-ece0d962e7e93ddc897786e2e9c0906f.webp" width="932" height="470" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>To <strong>create new personal Ondsel defaults</strong>, do the same, but instead of downloading, select the “Upload preferences for Personal” option. This will rewrite Ondsel ES defaults on your Lens account. Now every time you download preferences from your personal organization, your own defaults will be used.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Upload for Personal" src="/assets/images/backup-prefs-upload-for-personal-3e87d463cb858b2cdb8e1ccc8af878a9.webp" width="1216" height="1120" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Do you want to <strong>create new defaults for a team</strong>? Do the same, but this time right-click over any workspace that belongs to your team’s organization and select the “Upload preferences for ORGANIZATION_NAME” option.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Upload for company" src="/assets/images/backup-prefs-upload-for-company-58485872b6bf82696ca9f18561841fa6.webp" width="1216" height="1120" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Do you want to <strong>apply the same defaults to an entire team</strong>? Get them to log in with their accounts on Lens, then right-click over any workspace that belongs to the team’s organization and select the “Download preferences for ORGANIZATION_NAME” option.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Download for Personal" src="/assets/images/backup-prefs-download-for-company-f1669f4e4c9d64936a9c20e19c94e8a0.webp" width="1216" height="1120" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It’s that easy.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-whats-next">The “What’s Next?”<a href="#the-whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The “What’s Next?”" title="Direct link to The “What’s Next?”">​</a></h2><p>This simple idea could be extended later on. Perhaps, it would be useful to not only distribute preferences for a team, but also easily roll out 3rd-party addons and your own custom scripts? Or do something else? <a href="https://ondsel.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talk to us!</a></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We launched Ondsel Lens in 2023 as a FreeCAD-first product data management system. But there is one thing we cannot deny: STEP is a hugely important standard in the industry. If you go from one 3D CAD program to another, more often than not it’s what you use for model exchange. Even if you go from KiCad to SolidWorks, STEP is how you store your PCB designs for use in assemblies.</p><p>So we’ve just added support for STEP files in Ondsel Lens. You can upload, version, visualize and explore STEP geometry, you can also create share links for it and allow downloading the original file and STL and OBJ versions of it.</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:1rem"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Rk0QE-YZoqw?" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0"></iframe></div><p>For STEP files, we also display the entire model hierarchy in the tree view. This is new, it's something we are not doing for FreeCAD files yet, although we are planning to.</p><p>The tree view interface also uses checkboxes for selecting objects in the tree. This is a temporary solution, but if the majority of users end up loving it, we might keep it, so we are looking for your feedback.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Tree view in STEP files" src="/assets/images/step-treeview-a359ddf1c09eafd3edbdb5bee13ded0f.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You can already try yourself: <a href="https://lens.ondsel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign in</a>, upload a STEP file, and look around.</p><p>Many more exciting changes are coming, stay tuned!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’ve just released a bugfix update for the latest stable version of Ondsel Engineering Suite. The changes mostly affect users of the Assembly workbench, VarSets, and the Ondsel Lens addon.</p><p>Notable fixes:</p><ul><li>External linked subassemblies should work as expected now: links are recognized when creating joints and load properly (upstream issues <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/14906" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#14906</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/14907" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#14907</a>).</li><li>Grounded parts cannot be dragged anymore (upstream issue <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/14806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#14806</a>).</li><li>When you insert a component from parts you’ve just designed and saved, you will now see correct file names in the list of available components rather than ‘Unnamed.FCStd’ (upstream issue <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/14684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#14684</a>).</li><li>Another Insert Component bug fixed: groups were appearing in the list even if they had no components to insert (upstream issue <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/14933" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#14933</a>).</li><li>Belt, Gear, and Rack and Pinion joints don’t crash FreeCAD anymore (upstream issue <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/14458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#14458</a>).</li><li>The VarSet dialog now handles property types better. In particular, there’s now distinction between variable types that should not have an editor (editing values can be done in the property view) and types that are not supported, which are types that throw exceptions (upstream issue <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/15156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#15156</a>).</li><li>The VarSet dialog shouldn’t be causing a segfault anymore when you change the name of a property (upstream issue <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/15157" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#15157</a>).</li><li>The Lens addon was patched for minor things: a max retries error was fixed, the login dialog was improved to work on Qt6, API headers were improved, creating share links was fixed.</li></ul><p>Known issue: if you already had an earlier version of Ondsel ES installed, you will see a notification that a newer version of Ondsel Lens addon is available although we are shipping this release with the latest version already. This is because add-on installs from earlier versions are considered user modules, and user modules override system modules. In most cases, restarting Ondsel ES should fix the issue (the Lens addon automatically updates the local ‘user’ version), but in some cases you will need to manually update it.</p><p>You can get this new release <a href="https://lens.ondsel.com/download-and-explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>We are beginning to stabilize new features for the next larger release. So work is now focused on polishing both the upstream project and Ondsel-specific features.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ondsel recently implemented a bill of materials tool as part of the integrated assembly workbench.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back when we did the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-user-survey-results-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user survey</a>, the generation of bills of materials (BOM) was the next important thing after the ability to create assemblies. People don’t even need collision detection as much as they need their BOMs.</p><p>Based on this data, Pierre-Louis Boyer (Ondsel) recently added a Bill of Materials tool to the Assembly workbench for the upcoming Ondsel ES v2024.3 and FreeCAD v1.0. It is already available in weekly builds of Ondsel ES and the upstream project. </p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:1rem"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K0Ggtt2eTjQ" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0"></iframe></div><p>The implementation differs from that of other existing BOM solutions for FreeCAD. Let’s talk about why we did it that way and what the future might bring.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bom-which-one">BOM? Which one?<a href="#bom-which-one" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to BOM? Which one?" title="Direct link to BOM? Which one?">​</a></h2><p>First of all, there isn’t just one kind of BOM. “Bill of materials” is a rather generic name for any list of parts. In fact, BOMs differ in type and structure depending on their use. Sure, you can generate a spreadsheet that lists all the parts in a project, lists part numbers, and says how many of each there are, and what the cost is. Well, that would likely be a flat engineering bill of materials: </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Example of an engineering bill of materials" src="/assets/images/engineering-bom-example-d8d2cc317d89fb424979141101d7fc9f.webp" width="1357" height="1229" class="img_ev3q"> </p><p><em>Source: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330335978_Design_of_A_Fluidized_Bed_Reactor_For_Biomass_Pyrolysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design of A Fluidized Bed Reactor For Biomass Pyrolysis, by Alaba Bamido (ResearchGate)</a></em></p><p>If you want to represent the structure of the product and list out components per each part, that’s a multi-level, or indented BOM. Or maybe you are fine with just a list of sub-assemblies. That’s a single-level BOM.</p><p>If we want to show how to assemble the product, then we need a manufacturing BOM with a list of parts next to a drawing, with numbered parts. So we are talking about a BOM on a TechDraw page and automatically numbered parts in views.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Manufacturing bill of materials example" src="/assets/images/manufacturing-bom-example-347da0b5c74dc5dd1e630db63b093fde.webp" width="1920" height="1357" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></em></p><p>Or we could be talking about service BOMs where a technician has no use for a BOM of an entire product and only needs to know about parts where the repair will be happening. So you need to generate a subset of the original bill of materials.</p><p>There are <a href="https://www.optiproerp.com/blog/10-types-boms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even more types of BOMs</a> out there. Is it possible to handle this variety of use cases with existing implementations? Not really, and here is why.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-existing-implementations-fail">Where existing implementations fail<a href="#where-existing-implementations-fail" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Where existing implementations fail" title="Direct link to Where existing implementations fail">​</a></h2><p>With just one exception (more on that below), existing BOM generators for FreeCAD are workbench-specific:</p><ul><li>The built-in BOM generator in Fasteners WB collects information on all nuts and bolts inserted into your project but disregards the rest of the objects. It also uses extended names of bolts rather than names of objects visible in the project tree — a nice touch.</li><li>The <a href="https://github.com/amrit3701/FreeCAD-Reinforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reinforcement</a> workbench has a tool for creating rebar-specific bills of materials, with dimensions data, as well as total length, diameter, and weight of reinforcement.</li><li>The BOM generator in <a href="https://github.com/dprojects/Woodworking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Woodworking</a> WB is more like a cut list really and is similar to the one in Reinforcement: it also inserts specific data such as dimensions for pieces of wood and sorts them by thickness.</li><li>Both <a href="https://github.com/kbwbe/A2plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A2plus</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Assembly4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly4</a> have BOM generators that are specific to those workbenches as well.</li></ul><p>The recent <a href="https://github.com/APEbbers/BillOfMaterials-WB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill of Materials</a> workbench by Paul Ebbers is interesting because it seems to be the first attempt to create a more generic BOM functionality: it supports multiple existing assembly workbenches, as well as the Arch/BIM workbench.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="BOM workbench by Paul Ebbers" src="/assets/images/bom-workbench-paul-ebbers-a6faaeb93bb02502c2273ee6b4f1fd93.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Alas, it suffers from the same issue as other existing solutions we mentioned above: as soon as you make changes and trigger the tool again, it will simply overwrite the existing BOM. So if you insert any custom data (such as price per unit), you will have to add this data once again.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="design-and-workflow">Design and workflow<a href="#design-and-workflow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Design and workflow" title="Direct link to Design and workflow">​</a></h2><p>This particular design flaw in the workbench by Paul Ebbers — completely overwriting spreadsheets — is why the BOM tool developed by Ondsel creates a new parametric object in the project tree every time you use it. Internally, the BOM object is a subclass of spreadsheet, so it has its features like columns, but also some special features to generate spreadsheet data.</p><p>Creating parametric objects in the tree has two major benefits:</p><ol><li><p>You can have as many bills of materials as you like — single-level or multi-level, each with a different set of columns, etc.</p></li><li><p>Your custom data doesn’t get overwritten when you recreate the BOM.</p></li></ol><p>The workflow is simply this, as seen in the video at the beginning of this post:</p><ol><li><p>Double-click on an assembly object</p></li><li><p>Choose the BOM tool icon in the toolbar</p></li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Launch the Assembly BOM tool" src="/assets/images/assembly-bom-toolbar-0b0ebdea64bbc6f52bd1f47b5587679b.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><ol start="3"><li>Select the type of the BOM</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Select type of BOM" src="/assets/images/assembly-bom-select-type-17e72e4ca199533e17594e5a2a8bf209.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><ol start="4"><li>Add and reorganize columns</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Customize columns" src="/assets/images/assembly-bom-new-columns-c6a25369cbd07767bf09d66e7d78b140.webp" width="1377" height="1047" class="img_ev3q"></p><ol start="5"><li>Click OK to confirm</li></ol><p>This creates a BOM object in the tree…</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Generated parametric object" src="/assets/images/assembly-bom-parametric-object-5460e98f90eef9920baad9c5be83ebe0.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>…and a spreadsheet that you can edit and export.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Generated spreadsheet" src="/assets/images/assembly-bom-generated-spreadsheet-212e1bd2ea617081c1c70c4f495b7699.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>At any point in time, you can double-click the BOM object in the tree and change some settings. E.g. you can add a new column and update the spreadsheet without losing all the custom data that you added previously.</p><p>We also made it possible to use the BOM tool outside of assemblies. All you need is to switch from any other workbench (e.g. Rocket) to Assembly and click the BOM tool button on the toolbar. The workflow is the same.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="known-limitations">Known limitations<a href="#known-limitations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Known limitations" title="Direct link to Known limitations">​</a></h2><p>The initial implementation has several limitations, most of them stemming from underlying issues in the core of FreeCAD.</p><p>When you make multiple links to the same object in an assembly, the program will add numbers to their names and increment them as you add more links. The BOM tool handles that well. However, when you select multiple pockets and insert screws from the Fasteners WB, you get copies rather than links, and the BOM tool cannot handle this. The solution is likely to improve Fasteners, but there’s also a <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/12139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">core issue</a> to fix here.</p><p>Secondly, it would be rather useful to have customizable object names in the tree, this is also a <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/12141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">core issue</a>.</p><p>Contributor ‘pierreporte‘ also makes a good point that FreeCAD in general and the BOM tool, in particular, would greatly benefit from a better metadata implementation, as outlined in <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/12136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this core feature request</a>. </p><p>Finally, there is currently no way to make a regular flat bill of materials. This is on the radar and will be implemented.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next" title="Direct link to What’s next">​</a></h2><p>The initial implementation has been merged into upstream FreeCAD and is available in weekly builds of both Ondsel ES and the upstream project. We think this minimal implementation should work for starters, but there’s more that can be done:</p><ul><li>We think that the BOM functionality should be a core feature ready to use by bundled and 3rd party workbenches alike. So we likely need to move the tool to the core. Workbench developers then can use the new API in scripts and reuse the parametric object for their purposes. </li><li>It would be great to be able to generate a BOM directly from a view on a TechDraw page. </li><li>BOM generation from a view on a TD page typically involves numbering parts on views as well, this might mean that we need to implement auto-ballooning in TechDraw (it’s a useful feature regardless).</li></ul><p>For now, we are shipping the BOM tool as part of the Assembly workbench, but the plan is to make it a feature that looks and behaves more like a core feature. You can already use it even if there is no assembly in your project, but you have to switch to the Assembly workbench to use it. And that is one of the things where we want your feedback. </p><p>We requested a conversation with the upstream design working group, and for that, it would be great to have more use cases readily available to discuss. So we are looking for feedback from developers and users alike to tell us if our approach is sound and allows for the possible use cases we listed above.</p><p>Are you interested? Please drop by the upstream <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue tracker</a> and file a request or a bug report or you can join our <a href="https://discord.gg/7jmzezyyfP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a> (the #assembly-wb chat) and tell us what you think.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s time to mobilize the masses and focus on polishing FreeCAD so that it behaves like an actual v1.0 release.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s a valid question: how can FOSS CAD programs possibly compete with proprietary offerings? The answer is the community. Commercial CAD vendors need to pay for everything, but FreeCAD has an army of passionate volunteers and contributors. Grants for developers and Ondsel’s involvement are rather recent happenings. Mostly, the community has been managing the project for over 20 years on a shoestring budget or no budget at all — that is rather impressive.</p><p>Ondsel ES and FreeCAD have been developing a kind of symbiotic relationship. We build on FreeCAD, so we rely on it being great, but FreeCAD also benefits from new features and improvements we are bringing. However the upstream project is also larger than any group of developers: literally, everyone can help improve it, including non-programmers.</p><p>FreeCAD v1.0 is now right around the corner. It’s coming with <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/toponaming-problem-is-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toponaming issue mitigation</a>, brand new <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/assembly-workbench-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integrated assembly workbench</a>, vastly <a href="https://yorik.uncreated.net/blog/2024-007-freecad-news-21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improved BIM workflow</a> for architects, and <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/ondsel-es-2024-2/#further-sketcher-improvements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many UI/UX improvements</a> in Sketcher and TechDraw. Now it’s time to mobilize the masses and focus on polishing the program so that it behaves like an actual v1.0 release.</p><p>For contributors who are not developers, there are translations to update and documentation to write. But as users, there’s something else you do to help the project and gain something else in return.</p><p>FreeCAD has a particular kind of bug still lurking that we want to clean up. The program is rather strict about what it expects users to do. And if a user does the “wrong” thing, quite often the program won’t crash, but instead it will display a cryptic message in the Report View panel. For example, you can use zero in a sketch constraint, and you will see something like this:</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/fc-1-0-bughunt-example.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>We want to eliminate this behavior as much as possible. So here is our proposal. </p><ul><li><p><strong>If you are a developer, submit a report about this issue, provide a fix in a pull request, and we will send you a commemorative sticker for your laptop.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>If you are a user, submit a report about this issue to use, we will try to reproduce it, then fix it in Ondsel ES, submit the fix to the upstream project, and send you a commemorative sticker for your laptop.</strong></p></li></ul><p>Here are some of the methods to find those bugs:</p><ul><li>Input unexpected values</li><li>Enter a ‘0’ where it wants a number</li><li>Enter a letters where it wants a number</li><li>Enter unicode or special characters</li><li>Try random combinations of settings in task panels that take them</li><li>Drag panels around</li><li>Try other preference settings</li></ul><p>Just to clarify: we are not looking for feature requests or general bug reports. We are looking for very specific reports on uncaught errors that are displayed in the Report View panel, like on the screenshot above.</p><p>To reach us, you can use either <a href="https://discord.gg/7jmzezyyfP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/Ondsel-Development/FreeCAD/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue tracker</a>, if Discord doesn’t work for you. If you want a sticker, we’ll ask for your address privately.</p><p>Let’s make FreeCAD v1.0 even more fun to use together!</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unstable FreeCAD builds now ship with toponaming fixes. Let’s talk about the amazing work that the community did there.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the questions we've been getting from users regarding the release of Ondsel ES 2024.2 is whether we are shipping it with all the recent toponaming fixes enabled. The answer is 'no'. While most of the work in the TNP project is done, the code is largely untested by the larger community, so we don't feel comfortable shipping it in an actual release of Ondsel ES. However, let's take this opportunity to talk about TNP and the amazing work that the community did there.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-has-been-done">What has been done<a href="#what-has-been-done" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What has been done" title="Direct link to What has been done">​</a></h2><p>Just to reiterate, the toponaming problem is an inherent side effect of parametric modeling. Models are built up progressively with later features depending on the geometry from earlier steps. If the user goes back to an earlier step and changes it, later steps can break because the base feature they depend on changes. To avoid that, the CAD software needs to keep track of all geometry features you create and provide a way to recover when a certain geometry feature is taken from under another one. </p><p>RealThunder developed a solution for the toponaming problem in his own fork of FreeCAD, known as the LinkStage branch. While the code worked (and continues to work), there were two major problems with it: 1) the fork went out of sync with upstream FreeCAD, so LinkStage users couldn’t benefit from newer FreeCAD features, and vice versa, 2) the code wasn’t written in a way that was maintainable by anybody other than RealThunder. So a task force formed to migrate RealThunder's patches back to the upstream project. If you’re curious to learn more, we <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-topological-naming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote about the problem and the solution</a> last year.</p><p>After more than a year of work, the last phase of the toponaming project is now complete. While the team is still finding missing bits of code for Sketcher and PartDesign and adding them, anyone can rebuild the program with the toponaming fix and see that things are beginning to work as expected.</p><p>Because the application is doing more work to keep track of the geometry, we expected some performance impact. The team has been watching this closely and investigating potential performance regressions. So far, things actually look really good. Performance impact appears to be negligible. Much of that is thanks to RealThunder's extensive optimization.</p><p>The upstream team will not ship FreeCAD 1.0 without TNP fixes enabled. On Monday, they <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/8432#issuecomment-2121349967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enabled</a> the mitigation patchset in weekly builds by default to start getting the new code to a wider user base (as compared to the team that worked on the toponaming code).</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="TNP announcement on GitHub" src="/assets/images/announcement-91b6b8214383214abb0497641c5cc54c.webp" width="1660" height="347" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-we-have-learned">What we have learned<a href="#what-we-have-learned" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What we have learned" title="Direct link to What we have learned">​</a></h2><p>FreeCAD hasn’t had to tackle very many large-scale initiatives like this in the past. Only two come to mind: the Python3 port and the Qt5 port. So this was also an opportunity to learn and improve. Big projects like this aren’t sexy. They don’t add cool new features or UI/UX polish that thrills users. They are often bigger than a single contributor can achieve working alone and carry a lot of risk. All that means that big projects tend to languish. One answer is professional, paid development.</p><p>The model where paid contributors <em>and</em> volunteers work on the same project actually works. In some ways it provides the best of both worlds. We get an army of volunteers who can bring domain expertise, testing, and many small contributions while also encouraging a professional style of development, consistency, and scale.</p><p>We also witnessed just how much FreeCAD needs paid contributors. This might seem obvious to you, but there's a lot of FOSS lore around the idea that business interests and paid development corrupt free software projects. It doesn't have to be the case! </p><p>Paid development opens up a lot of possibilities for the project. While a team of volunteers might be able to deliver good results while working in their spare time, there is no guarantee that solutions will be forthcoming or that contributions will be maintainable when they arrive. We think a hybrid solution is the best way forward and we congratulate the entire team on their success: both RealThunder, Chris Hennes, and Pesc0, who contributed uncountable hours as volunteers, and bgbsww, CalligaroV, and John Dupuy (Ondsel), who did paid development. </p><p>But we also should be thanking the legions of users who donated to the FPA and made the FPA grants for CalligaroV and bgbsww possible. Without financial resources, this kind of development is really hard and often impossible. </p><p>Finally, starting to use <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/2/views/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub projects</a> was a rather smart move to improve how larger projects are managed. This brought clarity and better organization. The FPA is continuing to <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fpadf-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expand the use of grants</a>. Supported projects now include work on Sketcher, a brand new components library, better infrastructure for the project, and more.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What's next<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's next" title="Direct link to What's next">​</a></h2><p>For Ondsel ES users, we will enable the TNP code in the next stable release, 2024.3, as well as in weekly builds leading up to that.</p><p>Meanwhile, let's remember that model stability is a complex topic, and TNP mitigation helps only for a specific kind of model breakage. Models can still break for reasons that have nothing to do with topological naming. That's not even FreeCAD-specific. SolidWorks does that, Siemens NX does that, and so do other CAD programs: all CAD software can be used to design brittle models and there’s no substitute for good design principles.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about those principles, you can start with <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Feature_editing#Advice_for_creating_stable_models" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this list</a> of suggestions. Following them might sound like doing things backwards, but it will actually make you a better designer.</p><p>Finally, we encourage you to <a href="https://www.freecad.org/sponsor.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">donate to the FPA</a> so that more complex projects could be tackled, there is no shortage of those in FreeCAD.</p>]]></content>

In the release notes here, we only cover changes that the Ondsel team implemented. Some of them have already been merged to upstream and some are pending review.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="assembly-explosion-tool-new-joint-types-limits-and-stabilization">Assembly: Explosion tool, new joint types, limits, and stabilization<a href="#assembly-explosion-tool-new-joint-types-limits-and-stabilization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Assembly: Explosion tool, new joint types, limits, and stabilization" title="Direct link to Assembly: Explosion tool, new joint types, limits, and stabilization">​</a></h2><p>For this release, we focused on bringing a more complete and polished experience to users of the integrated assembly workbench.</p><p>The first major change is an initial implementation of an <strong>explosion tool</strong>: open and activate an assembly, switch to <em>Create Explode View</em> tool, select a part or several parts, then use the transform gizmo to move them in 3D space. </p><p>Once you’ve done dragging parts out, you can place the exploded view into a TechDraw page. You can create multiple exploded views of an assembly, e.g. to demonstrate stages of assembling some complex piece of machinery. For simple assemblies, you can use a radial explosion mode. </p><p>We covered this new feature in more detail in a <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/exploded-views-in-assembly-workbench/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent blog post</a>.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/oes-2024-2/oes-2024-2-assembly-exploded-view.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>Another new feature was directly requested by users on Discord: <strong>limits</strong> to available degrees of freedom in <em>Revolute</em>, <em>Cylindrical</em>, and <em>Slider</em> joints. This allows defining a range of motion for objects under constraints.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/oes-2024-2/oes-2024-2-assembly-limits.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>The next batch of new features is a series of new joint types that are useful in mechanical design and were requested by users: Rack and Pinion, Screw, Gears, and Belt.</p><p><strong>Rack and Pinion</strong> simulates the conversion from linear motion to circular or vice versa. To create it, you need a part with a sliding joint and a part with a revolute joint.</p><p>The <strong>Screw</strong> joint simulates the motion that is both sliding and revolution:</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/oes-2024-2/oes-2024-2-assembly-screw-joint.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>The <strong>Gears</strong> joint helps simulating a gears system:</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/oes-2024-2/oes-2024-2-assembly-gears-joint.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>The <strong>Belt</strong> joint allows simulating transmission of power multiple shafts using pulleys or gears and an elastic belt or a gear chain.</p><p>The new joint types are less tested and should be considered experimental.</p><p>Finally, we fixed a number of bugs in the assembly workbench and improved overall user experience: added dragging to the <em>Distance</em> joint to simulate motion, clarified terminology.</p><p>New and improved icons were contributed by members of the upstream design working group.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sheet-metal-workbench-now-shipped-with-ondsel-es">Sheet Metal workbench now shipped with Ondsel ES<a href="#sheet-metal-workbench-now-shipped-with-ondsel-es" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Sheet Metal workbench now shipped with Ondsel ES" title="Direct link to Sheet Metal workbench now shipped with Ondsel ES">​</a></h2><p>Following the user survey, we <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/sheetmetal-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started</a> shipping the <a href="https://github.com/shaise/FreeCAD_SheetMetal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SheetMetal workbench</a> by Shaise as part of core Ondsel ES experience. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="SM screenshot" src="/assets/images/oes-2024-2-sheet-metal-8ea016af3dec2336eb3d6784f581e8d9.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We also resumed implementing both core and UX/UI changes in the workbench: refactored the code for better core and user interface separation, added a parametric unfold object, as well as a task panel for the <em>Bend</em> command. More interfaces for various task panels have been created based on the proposal by the design working group at FreeCAD, actual code is to be written.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Bend task panel" src="/assets/images/oes-2024-2-sheet-metal-flange-task-panel-19b7249d64335b3d88acf64483a6f16b.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We’ll continue revamping the Sheet Metal workbench after this release. All changes are being submitted for review to the upstream project.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="further-sketcher-improvements">Further Sketcher improvements<a href="#further-sketcher-improvements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Further Sketcher improvements" title="Direct link to Further Sketcher improvements">​</a></h2><p>We’ve added several major improvements to the Sketcher workbench. One significant workflow improvement is the new <strong>automatic midpoint constraint</strong>. It was made specifically in response to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVp8fF2LmM8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his video</a> by Teaching Tech where the lack of this feature significantly increased the amount of time to accomplish a task.</p><p>We timed ourselves completing the task — and even though we knew exactly what to do (use a symmetry constraint), we confirmed that a basic operation was indeed taking more time and wasn’t obvious. So we implemented a new midpoint constraint. There are multiple uses for it, but for the sake of a closure let’s illustrate it using the exact scenario in the Teaching Tech video — the entire model:</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/oes-2024-2/oes-2024-2-sketcher-midpoint-constraint.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>The next major change is the <strong>Symmetry tool</strong> rework. Now you can just select your Sketcher object, select the <em>Symmetry</em> tool, and then hover geometry that you want to mirror the selected object over. This will render a preview that you can confirm with a single-click. Not only that, any line or a point can be a reference object for symmetry now.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/oes-2024-2/oes-2024-2-sketcher-symmetry.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>We also reworked the <strong>Fillet</strong> tool and added a basic <strong>Chamfer</strong> tool. Rather than having two Fillet tools, you now have one where <em>Preserve Corner</em> is an option in the <em>Tasks</em> panel.</p><p>The new <em>Chamfer</em> tool works similarly: click a point in a polyline or a rectangular geometry object to create a chamfer, optionally preserving the corner. The tool will automatically create a chamfer with two equal angles. To control the chamfer’s size you can add a dimension to either the arc or to the edge.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Fillet and Chamfer" src="/assets/images/oes-2024-2-sketcher-fillet-chamfer-f4c8fb59c9409f57468a58aaac4ec18d.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Furthermore, we extended the <strong>Trim</strong> tool to support continuous trimming. Select the tool, hold the left mouse button, and start dragging. All the lines you cross in that mode will be deleted.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/oes-2024-2/oes-2024-2-sketcher-trimming.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>Finally, we improved default toolbars, as well as visualization of various geometric features:</p><ul><li>Construction lines are now displayed with dashed pattern and in blue, thanks to newly added geometry rendering customizations.</li><li>The rendering of arc angles and line angles, as well as the rendering of distances between arcs has been improved.</li><li>The points’ colors are now more meaningful and reflect their actual nature: normal vs construction vs internal etc. Also points now become red when all the stacked points are coincident, enabling users to spot easily opened wires.</li><li>Angles now have arrowheads.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="techdraw-cleanup-and-new-features">TechDraw cleanup and new features<a href="#techdraw-cleanup-and-new-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to TechDraw cleanup and new features" title="Direct link to TechDraw cleanup and new features">​</a></h2><p>Implementing support for exploded views in TechDraw gave us an incentive to start hacking on that workbench. The first major change is a <strong>Smart Dimension tool</strong> that works similarly to the one in Sketcher. With the usual workflow, you select a geometric feature in a view and then use a dedicated tool, then select another feature and use a dedicated tool again, and so on.</p><p>The Smart Dimension tool workflow is superior in many cases: you simply select the tool and click on geometry features. The tool will change the type of dimension depending on the type of the feature you click on. And when multiple dimensions are possible, you can switch between those using the <strong>M</strong> shortcut — same as in Sketcher.</p><p>And just like with Sketcher, you can choose whether you want both the smart dimension tool and dedicated dimension tools to be displayed grouped or next to each other in the toolbar.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/oes-2024-2/oes-2024-2-techdraw-smart-dimensioning.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>Snapping has been introduced for the dimensions, letting you position them in an easier fashion. It has also been added for views, in particular for section views — to align them with their base views.</p><p>Instead of dedicated buttons for inserting different types of objects from the tree (View, Project Group, Spreadsheet, Arch WB Object, SVG, Image) you now have just one button. If a project tree object is selected, the command will insert that object. If there is no selection, it will prompt you for an SVG file or an image.</p><p>We did further cleanup: removed <em>Cosmetic eraser</em> (selecting and pressing <strong>Del</strong> already does the job) and <em>Project Shape</em> from the toolbar, fixed the dragging and dropping of views, and added auto-switching to TechDraw when double-clicking a page in the project tree.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-workbench-selector">New workbench selector<a href="#new-workbench-selector" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New workbench selector" title="Direct link to New workbench selector">​</a></h2><p>We implemented <strong>TabBar</strong> — a new way to switch between workbenches that makes things more discoverable to new users and more convenient to a subset of existing users. The idea is loosely based on the <a href="https://github.com/triplus/SelectorToolbar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SelectorToolbar</a> addon by triplus. We also disabled less popular workbenches by default, so users will get a more polished experience.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="TabBar screenshot" src="/assets/images/oes-2024-2-tabbar-e366d86a1ce6af98a39d5a858ba7c0da.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The tab bar is configurable. First off, you can add workbenches that we disabled by default by simply clicking the <strong>+</strong> button and choosing a workbench of interest. The pre-existing “Workbench selector position” applies to TabBar as well. You can also choose the style: icons, icons + text, or just text.</p><p>Lastly, you can easily go back to using the combobox list for switching between workbenches. The option is on the <em>Workbenches / Available Workbenches</em> page of the <em>Preferences</em> dialog. Alternatively, you can get there by clicking the <strong>+</strong> button and selecting <em>Preferences</em> at the bottom of the list of workbenches.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="custom-first-run-wizard-vs-upstream-solution">Custom first-run wizard vs upstream solution<a href="#custom-first-run-wizard-vs-upstream-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Custom first-run wizard vs upstream solution" title="Direct link to Custom first-run wizard vs upstream solution">​</a></h2><p>In version 2024.1, we introduced a custom first-run wizard made in anticipation of a better upstream solution. This solution is now available and built into the new Start page thanks to the work by Chris Hennes. So we removed the custom wizard.</p><p>While at that, we shipped the updated OpenDark theme by Joe Sardos, as well as his new OpenLight theme, both being parts of the <a href="https://github.com/obelisk79/OpenTheme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenTheme</a> project.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quick-measure">Quick measure<a href="#quick-measure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Quick measure" title="Direct link to Quick measure">​</a></h2><p>While we are shipping the new upstream measurement tool, in many cases it’s really convenient to have basic measurements readily at hand at any time. So we added a new feature called <strong>Quick Measure</strong>. It sits on the right side of the sidebar and displays context-sensitive measurements: length for edges, radius for circles etc. You can double-click to select the entire measurement and press <strong>Ctrl+C</strong> to copy it to the clipboard.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick Measure, radius" src="/assets/images/oes-2024-2-quick-measure-radius-42641339e0a79723fb0241fc0fafbe34.webp" width="1892" height="1187" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>While it works in Sketcher, it’s most useful in Part Design, because in addition to basic things like length and radius  you can see angles between adjacent edges, nominal length (distance between two selected faces or two parallel lines), area for a face or entire body, or total area for multiple faces in different bodies.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick Measure, total area" src="/assets/images/oes-2024-2-quick-measure-total-area-a33e83188ccdc9739738f40509048441.webp" width="1896" height="1188" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="core-support-for-custom-properties">Core support for custom properties<a href="#core-support-for-custom-properties" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Core support for custom properties" title="Direct link to Core support for custom properties">​</a></h2><p>This new version of Ondsel ES introduces variable sets, or VarSets — a brand new system for creating custom properties (or <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/build-system-for-custom-data-elements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data elements</a>, if you will). The intention is to provide functionality for custom properties in core to support this functionality out-of-the-box, without relying on 3rd-party solutions such as the Dynamic Data workbench and CAM (Path) PropertyBag. It also improves the experience for users who are not happy with the Spreadsheet workbench for creating parametric models.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="New variable in a varset" src="/assets/images/oes-2024-2-upload-new-varset-2d6e22e322fa883060456b7d0e23a638.webp" width="1327" height="952" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>VarSets store variables that can be used to parameterize your designs, for example in the expression editor. So whether you are sketching and dimensioning or filletting or making arrays, you can create some custom variables (in multiple custom groups, if you like), set values, do math with them in your design, and then adjust variables’ values in the <em>Property View</em> panel as you see fit. And since the panel sits right next to the viewport, you can see your design update live. </p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/oes-2024-2/oes-2024-2-varsets-desktop.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>When you design a parametric model with VarSets and store it as a public model on Lens and share a link, other users will be able to customize your design with variables that you defined, download an STL file, and 3D-print it.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of custom variables in Lens UI" src="/assets/images/oes-2024-2-varsets-in-lens-19f4a29bb3e0e06a36dc259a13e45a95.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ondsel-lens-changes">Ondsel Lens changes<a href="#ondsel-lens-changes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ondsel Lens changes" title="Direct link to Ondsel Lens changes">​</a></h2><p>We’ve accumulated a lot of improvements and fixes in Lens since January.</p><p>The service now renders colors of parts and applies finer tessellation to original geometry for smoother look and feel. It also lists available parts, so you can toggle their visibility while exploring designs.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/oes-2024-2/oes-2024-2-color-bodies-list.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>Managing organizations is now possible: you can add users to organizations and workspaces, organize them in groups with read/write access, edit descriptions of both org and workspaces, check out versions of design, and more.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Lens org setup" src="/assets/images/oes-2024-2-lens-org-setup-b3e4dc7aca6131311a2d6e5fcf2e6cab.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It’s now possible to promote content on your public organization’s page: pick models you like, or even entire workspaces, organizations, and users, and feature them by clicking the bullhorn icon.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/oes-2024-2/oes-2024-2-promotions.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>You can also bookmark public (models with share links) and private models for your organization, so only you and your teammates will see those bookmarks. The Lens add-on for Ondsel ES and FreeCAD has been updated to list available bookmarks for all organizations you belong to. You can also open respective CAD designs directly in Ondsel ES.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/oes-2024-2/oes-2024-2-bookmarks.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>It’s also possible to store your Ondsel ES preferences on Lens now. This is done on a per-organization basis. There are two common use cases here.</p><p>The first one is where you are planning to move your work along with preferences to a different computer, so you right-click on any workspace that belongs to your personal organization and choose <em>Upload preferences for Personal</em>. Then on a new computer you install Ondsel ES, log into Lens, right-click again, and choose <em>Download preferences for Personal</em>, then restart Ondsel ES for changes to take effect.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Upload preferences for Personal organization" src="/assets/images/oes-2024-2-upload-prefs-e8caee0a9791ccb26653638985c987d7.webp" width="1588" height="1116" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The second use case is rolling out the same preferences for an entire team. In that case you do the same, but when uploading preferences, you right-click on any workspaces belonging to an organization that your team is part of. Then when they download preferences from that organization, they all get the same settings.</p><p>In the future, it will be possible to roll out preferred 3rd-party addons for the entire team the same way.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s Next<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s Next" title="Direct link to What’s Next">​</a></h2><p>You should expect further improvements in Assembly, Sketcher, TechDraw, Sheet Metal, as well as in the Lens service.  The Lens service will become an increasingly useful and important part of the Ondsel experience with more features for professional users.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that the basic assembly workflow is mostly complete and operational in Ondsel ES, we are beginning to add new tools. One of the features coming in the next release are exploded views.</p><p>Proprietary software vendors typically ship exploded views as part of either the assembly feature set (e.g. SolidWorks) or the animation environment (e.g. Fusion 360). Either way, you typically get controllable transitions from one explosion step to another.</p><p>For Ondsel ES 2024.2, we are aiming for a minimum viable product: a tool that creates exploded views and a possibility to place an exploded view on a TechDraw page.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="creating-exploded-views-manually">Creating exploded views manually<a href="#creating-exploded-views-manually" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Creating exploded views manually" title="Direct link to Creating exploded views manually">​</a></h2><p>Open an assembly project, double-click the assembly object in the tree, and select the ‘Create Exploded View’ tool in the toolbar or press <strong>V</strong>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Original view of the assembly" src="/assets/images/create-exploded-view-4ca394e93866ae1335263c16c73ab370.webp" width="1265" height="657" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Select a part or several parts in the assembly and use the transform gizmo to move them away from the rest of the assembly. You can move it along one axis or all three, if you like:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Move a part" src="/assets/images/drag-parts-out-3225a37750470fde516d8e34d1c8425a.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You also have control over the position of the transform gizmo: once a part is selected, the Task panel displays an ‘Align dragger’ drop-down menu with three options: aligning to the center of a part, to its origin, or to arbitrary geometry that you can select:</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/integrated-assembly-explosion-align-dragger.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>Once you move a part, the tool will render a trace for each movement as a dashed line:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Moved part with a trace" src="/assets/images/movement-trace-lines-4e0e1ab5ea727c7b6a7953f6fabd3e11.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You can also create multiple exploded views, e.g. first you take screw out of an enclosure, then you move the cover:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Second exploded view" src="/assets/images/second-exploded-view-6b33c49049b85a9217f0cee0b5b8e8ad.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="exploding-radially">Exploding radially<a href="#exploding-radially" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Exploding radially" title="Direct link to Exploding radially">​</a></h2><p>Depending on the model and use case, you might want to simply move all parts away from each other as if an explosion happened in the middle of an assembly, and the shock wave moved parts in different directions.</p><p>To do that, you can use an experimental tool for radial explosion. Simply initiate a new exploded view and click the ‘Explode radially’ button on the task panel. This will select all parts in the assembly and display a transform gizmo in the 3D view. Dragging it by any of the three axes will “explode” the model radially.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/integrated-assembly-radial-explosion.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>Please note that for now, we are using a simple implementation where the radial explosion is calculated from the assembly’s 3D bounding box. This is not set in stone.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="generating-technical-documentation">Generating technical documentation<a href="#generating-technical-documentation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Generating technical documentation" title="Direct link to Generating technical documentation">​</a></h2><p>Placing an exploded view on a TechDraw page works just as expected: you simply switch to the TechDraw workbench, add a page, select the exploded view object in the tree, and click ‘Insert View’:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Exploded view on a TD page" src="/assets/images/exploded-view-on-td-page-11f34c059cb8e33d13a016787d6d9946.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next?<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next?" title="Direct link to What’s next?">​</a></h2><p>Of course, we have lots of ideas on how to improve the Exploded View tool further. We could be creating radial explosions from the center of mass or from the fixed part. We could be adding a simple animation system based on keyframes. So this is one of the cases where we rely on user feedback.</p><p>We are shipping the minimal implementation in the next stable release of Ondsel ES for wider testing. We’ll adjust development plans for exploded views based on the feedback we receive from you.</p>]]></content>

It’s CATIA — a generations-old 3D CAD program that served as an inspiration in the early days of FreeCAD. The two programs share more than just some core concepts: they’ve been struggling with many of the same issues and went in different directions to fix them.</p><p>A lot of companies that use CATIA are interested in migrating away and are looking at open-source alternatives. It's a good time to look at the reasons why and consider what they could be looking for in an open-source program such as Ondsel ES.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-bit-of-history">A bit of history<a href="#a-bit-of-history" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A bit of history" title="Direct link to A bit of history">​</a></h2><p>First off, CATIA isn’t just old, it’s <em>ancient</em>. The project was started in 1977 by Dassault Systèmes for designing fighter jets. That was back when Jimmy Carter was president, and disco was all the rage. Even today, when you ask which Dassault’s software you should pick, CATIA or SolidWorks, you are likely to hear something along the lines of “if it has wheels or wings, go CATIA”. Many big names in the automotive and aerospace industries rely on this software, both in the US and the EU.</p><p>Dassault has been very conservative about updating the software, and users are equally conservative about upgrading. They released v5 in 1998, then v6 in 2009. Both are still widely used.  Since 2014 they’ve been trying hard to get everyone to switch to 3DEXPERIENCE CATIA.</p><blockquote><p>“...in aerospace most projects are decades old at this point, so you must learn the older version in order to support them.” - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/51rnly/comment/d7ebs0k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XAeroR35</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advantages-and-struggles">Advantages and struggles<a href="#advantages-and-struggles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Advantages and struggles" title="Direct link to Advantages and struggles">​</a></h2><p>For the original desktop software (v5 and v6), some of the benefits (e.g. over SolidWorks) are very decent performance when handling large assemblies, stability, and great surfacing tools. More than that, CATIA v5/v6 comes with a file-based product lifecycle management (PLM) system.</p><p>But software packages don’t get to be 47 years old and retain their users without making some serious trade-offs. In the case of CATIA, that seems to be largely about user experience. Both v5 and v6 are difficult to master. They have a dated UI that clearly shows its design origins in the 1990’s. Some of these issues will look painfully familiar to users of FreeCAD:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="UX/UI in CATIA" src="/assets/images/ux-ui-catia-cd3e65ecb905a82d552dc832f6f5bd86.webp" width="893" height="586" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CATIA/comments/1bd27vs/what_is_this_icon_how_can_i_access_the_sketches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what is this icon?! How can I access the sketches on this element?</a></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="UX/UI in FreeCAD" src="/assets/images/ux-ui-freecad-fb876b349802a2b5146f0e1fbb19b67b.webp" width="1255" height="657" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Source: <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=77373" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What does this little purple icon near sketch icon mean?</a></p><p>As software goes, CATIA v5/v6 is unforgiving. You have to use the functions exactly as they're made, and you don’t have the luxury of shortcuts and keyboard accelerators for tools. UI customization is limited or non-existent.</p><p>It’s not that the original CATIA is poorly designed — it isn’t. It simply hasn’t kept up with the times.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="collaboration">Collaboration<a href="#collaboration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Collaboration" title="Direct link to Collaboration">​</a></h2><p>Dassault clearly understands the importance of collaboration and has for a long time.  They included a native PLM solution long ago. A while back, Dassault started to work on their UI/UX problems and they started by updating their collaboration tools. 3DEXPERIENCE is a newer cloud-based suite that includes a PLM platform and a modernized version of CATIA.  Unfortunately, both the new CATIA and the underlying platform arrived with their own quirks that have alienated many customers.</p><p>Users commonly cite frustrations with frequent crashes especially when performing complex operations, and documentation never catching up with development etc. The database approach to organizing projects (you need to tag files) and managing revisions sometimes leads to loss of important data. The experience is sufficiently infuriating that some users want to go back to older PDM/PLM solutions by Dassault or switch to newer ones by other vendors.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-cost">The cost<a href="#the-cost" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The cost" title="Direct link to The cost">​</a></h2><p>And let’s take a minute to talk about the cost. The pricing varies a lot year to year, but also depends on what modules you need and other factors that Dassault doesn’t disclose openly. You need to request a quote from a distributor. But there’s no arguing that CATIA is expensive — really expensive. It’s at least in the early 5 figures for the one-time payment and at least $2,000 for further annual license maintenance — per seat.</p><p>Pretty much the same goes for 3DEXPERIENCE CATIA. At this price point the product still causes a lot of frustration with frequent bugs and lukewarm customer support (a thread like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidWorks/comments/1al1jtr/3dexperience_really_that_bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a> will give you a pretty good idea).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="putting-things-in-perspective">Putting things in perspective<a href="#putting-things-in-perspective" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Putting things in perspective" title="Direct link to Putting things in perspective">​</a></h2><p>While some customers need the stability of this old software and its proven performance, many are looking at the rapidly improving landscape of alternatives — including open-source ones — and are interested in migrating. This is evident even by looking at this Google Trends chart:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="CATIA interest over years" src="/assets/images/catia-through-the-years-9af7d761867f39cd49369152fb28e641.webp" width="2106" height="786" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Let’s put things in perspective and compare that to some other commercial offerings:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="CATIA vs SolidWorks, NX, Inventor" src="/assets/images/catia-vs-nx-sw-inv-f1fc7cd89da5c45c2409340633d6e5ae.webp" width="2106" height="786" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Blue: CATIA. Red: NX. Yellow: SolidWorks. Green: Inventor. </p><p>Did the new 3DEXPERIENCE platform help things along? If you trust Google Trends data, it appears that the new platform hasn’t succeeded in picking up the waning interest in CATIA.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="CATIA vs 3DEXPERIENCE" src="/assets/images/catia-vs-3dx-09eb50b987031a56072f74af402aa9fa.webp" width="2106" height="786" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Blue: CATIA. Red: 3DEXPERIENCE</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-ondselfreecad-is-handling-the-same-issues">How Ondsel/FreeCAD is handling the same issues<a href="#how-ondselfreecad-is-handling-the-same-issues" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Ondsel/FreeCAD is handling the same issues" title="Direct link to How Ondsel/FreeCAD is handling the same issues">​</a></h2><p>Comparing CATIA and Ondsel/FreeCAD is comparing apples and oranges. They have different users, history, architecture and geometry kernels. But FreeCAD was <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/History" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heavily inspired by CATIA</a> and shares many core concepts. FreeCAD’s UI borrows ideas from CATIA and, subsequently, suffers many of the same shortcomings. It’s enlightening to see how the open-source community addresses the same problems.</p><p>For the UI/UX challenges, the larger FreeCAD community is doing something that Dassault isn’t doing. Rather than scrapping everything and starting all over again (with mixed results), it is working to resolve the problems incrementally: mitigating the toponaming issue, improving UX/UI, building a better materials system, adding an integrated assembly workbench, and more. </p><p>At Ondsel, we’re working to address the collaboration piece. Our PDM system (Lens) integrates directly into the desktop software. We’re also shipping our own flavor of the desktop software with Lens integration and an even more polished user experience.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-users-care">Do users care?<a href="#do-users-care" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Do users care?" title="Direct link to Do users care?">​</a></h2><p>The recent user survey came with several eye-openers, one of them being a <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-user-survey-results-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">larger percentage</a> of professional FreeCAD users than we expected — nearly 45% of the sampling (650 respondents). This doesn’t mean that FreeCAD could be a drop-in replacement for any other commercial CAD program (it simply doesn’t work that way). But, again, once you put things in perspective, things have been changing…</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="CATIA vs FreeCAD" src="/assets/images/catia-vs-freecad-bc6ba407fba416194426e24060b2db85.webp" width="2106" height="786" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Blue: CATIA. Red: FreeCAD.</p><p>It’s easy to argue that the price point of either FreeCAD or Ondsel ES + Lens makes them a more favorable choice as compared to Dassault’s offerings. But that is not the only decision factor, and for a good reason.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="is-it-right-for-you">Is it right for you?<a href="#is-it-right-for-you" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Is it right for you?" title="Direct link to Is it right for you?">​</a></h2><p>Ondsel probably isn’t the right choice for the most demanding engineering tasks yet but it is moving in that direction.  In the meantime, Ondsel users are enjoying a powerful, efficient, and attractive design tool at a fraction of the cost of commercial tools like CATIA.  And it comes with an enthusiastic community and new updates that happen more frequently than the US census.</p><p>You can follow our progress in the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> and on <a href="https://ondsel.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a> or <a href="https://lens.ondsel.com/download-and-explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">try the software</a> for yourself today.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The SheetMetal workbench is really important for users, so let's have a long-term strategy for it.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the conclusions in the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-user-survey-results-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user survey series</a> is that the SheetMetal workbench is really important for users. 9,2% respondents rely on this addon to do their job, it’s also the third most popular choice for what to pay money for by professionals and the fourth most popular choice overall, after UI/UX, TNP, and Assembly WB.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="SheetMetal Wb in Ondsel ES" src="/assets/images/sheetmetal-intro-screenshot-afc39c08721b35027e2cef3fe1359d57.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The sheet metal functionality is commonly included in proprietary CAD products — Solidworks, NX, Onshape, and Fusion 360 to name just a few. Users expect that this workbench should look and work as an integral part of FreeCAD — if not actually be shipped by default.</p><p>Ondsel strives to make the out-of-box user experience as good as possible and also to meet the most common needs of commercial users. For us, having Sheetmetal installed by default is an obvious choice. We can’t force this workbench on the upstream project, but we can help improve it to the point where it’s consistent with the rest of the program and performs even better than today. We can encourage some long-term thinking about this great workbench and start contributing to it the way we contribute to the core project. So we started with a technical review of SheetMetal and then asked the FreeCAD design working group to do the UX review.</p><p>Let’s talk about what a long-term strategy might involve and what the technical and the UX reviews looked like and what their outcome is.</p><p>This post is made in collaboration with Joe Sardos (Obelisk), one of the participants in the
design working group and author of the excellent OpenDark theme used in Ondsel ES.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-review">Technical review<a href="#technical-review" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technical review" title="Direct link to Technical review">​</a></h2><p>Brad Collette, Ondsel’s CTO, did the first technical review of the SheetMetal WB during the summer of 2023. He ended up <a href="https://github.com/shaise/FreeCAD_SheetMetal/pull/280" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refactoring</a> some of the code to separate UI from logic and make the workbench scriptable.</p><p>A more thorough look revealed some of the things we still need to change to make SheetMetal feel like core functionality.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="uiux-that-is-consistent-with-freecad-norms">UI/UX that is consistent with FreeCAD norms<a href="#uiux-that-is-consistent-with-freecad-norms" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to UI/UX that is consistent with FreeCAD norms" title="Direct link to UI/UX that is consistent with FreeCAD norms">​</a></h3><p>Many of the functions that a user can initiate in the workbench result in objects in the tree. For example the user can select a face of a solid and ‘make a wall’. This immediately modifies the shape in the 3D window and adds a ‘Bend’ object to the tree. The user can select the Bend object and adjust many properties of it. To be more consistent with the overall program’s workflow, creating a wall should open a task panel that allows the user to set the properties directly. Double-clicking the Bend object should re-open the task panel and allow the user to change settings. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="parametric-unfold-object">Parametric unfold object<a href="#parametric-unfold-object" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Parametric unfold object" title="Direct link to Parametric unfold object">​</a></h3><p>An important feature in the workbench is the ability to select a shape and ‘unfold’ it to create a flattened representation that can be cut from sheet stock. However, the unfold object isn’t parametrically linked to the original shape. So if the original shape changes — perhaps because the user adjusted an important dimension — the unfolded version has to be deleted and manually recreated. That’s why the unfold object needs to become parametric by design.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="better-unfolder">Better unfolder<a href="#better-unfolder" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Better unfolder" title="Direct link to Better unfolder">​</a></h3><p>The logic for converting a folded shape into an unfolded representation is complex and computationally expensive. It’s currently implemented in Python. Re-implementing this logic in C++ would provide substantial performance improvements. However, workbenches implemented as addons can’t have C++ logic, so this change would mean that at least some parts of the workbench, such as the unfolder, need to become part of the FreeCAD.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cleaner-refactored-code">Cleaner, refactored code<a href="#cleaner-refactored-code" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cleaner, refactored code" title="Direct link to Cleaner, refactored code">​</a></h3><p>In general, the SheetMetal workbench is well written and the code is well organized. There are some areas where refactoring would be beneficial, especially to allow sheet metal functions to be used in scripts or headless operation.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="unit-tests">Unit tests<a href="#unit-tests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Unit tests" title="Direct link to Unit tests">​</a></h3><p>Like in much of FreeCAD, unit tests don’t exist in SheetMetal. Implementing these would make it easier for contributors to add new features without breaking core logic.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="translation-support-via-crowdin">Translation support via Crowdin<a href="#translation-support-via-crowdin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Translation support via Crowdin" title="Direct link to Translation support via Crowdin">​</a></h3><p>Some parts of the workbench source have already been written to support internationalization and translation. The workbench has gotten some well-deserved love from translators. A thorough review of the UI and source code with an eye towards translation is needed.</p><p>With the UI/UX  in mind, we approached the design working group in February this year to ask them for a full review of the workbench. Over to Joe Sardos.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="design-review">Design review<a href="#design-review" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Design review" title="Direct link to Design review">​</a></h2><p>First we, the design working group, studied sheet metal production basics (some of the design group members had some professional experience in this area) and terminology. This resulted in a review of function naming, with some suggested changes in order to support clarity and better differentiation between functions.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="screenshot" src="/assets/images/sheetmetal-terminology-e9ddcbee1627f805d3a4c328454f8423.webp" width="1310" height="513" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The second part of the design review process was to understand what the current workflow was. In a nutshell, we used the workbench extensively ourselves and watched YouTube videos of other users interacting with the workbench. We looked for things that were particularly deficient/inefficient. The main takeaway was that everything was manipulated from the property panel. While concise, it was not particularly well-organized or efficient.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="screenshot" src="/assets/images/sheetmetal-properties-d8a15e527014a8e0dc5d5b151c9b1c09.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The next aspect was approaching if/how the workflow or modeling process could be improved or streamlined. One example here is our recommendation for a new container which is effectively a Part Design Body container with added properties related to sheet metal materials. Once those settings are defined at the very start of the modeling process, this absolves the user from needing to manipulate this at any time later.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="screenshot" src="/assets/images/sheetmetal-container-eae0b1fec9ddee59b8f423129b47ead7.webp" width="1163" height="1034" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The recommendation for a container does not mean the container will be required, the intent is not to restrict existing workbench combinations, but encourage a specific approach.</p><p>After establishing some important fundamentals about sheet metal design and a proposed workflow, we evaluated each function and what its intended purpose was. We also looked into reports that users of Sheet Metal have to jump over to Part Design for some common functions (the reports were also supported by some of the YouTube videos we watched and forum threads we reviewed). This led us to a full reorganization of the toolbars and recommended improvements to the toolbutton icons.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="screenshot" src="/assets/images/sheetmetal-icons-1fa645e328b91cadfd54f7e0d3a318f0.webp" width="1520" height="1409" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>At this point, we had an interesting debate to determine some best practices for task panel layout, use of widget types, and visual/behavioral consistency. For example, we needed to figure out whether we should recommend static width of panels, how to manage single vs dual column layouts. Among other considerations — accounting for language translations with much longer words than what is found in English (we heard you, Polish speakers!).</p><p>After this, we developed mockups of panels and discussed them in the open on FreeCAD's Discord server. We debated pros and cons, and eventually patterns and norms began to develop. These will eventually translate into the <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/designguide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Guide</a> section of the handbook to establish standard guidelines for how task panels should be constructed.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="screenshot" src="/assets/images/sheetmetal-task-panel-0609ad1f569a2782f774f41144b78589.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I expect that this is just the beginning though, and these guidelines will continue to evolve and improve as we review/develop more task panels in the future. Particularly paying attention to user feedback on the new tasks. Understandably in its current state, the new guidelines would most likely not account for the needs of all existing functions throughout the entirety of FreeCAD. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="strategy">Strategy<a href="#strategy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Strategy" title="Direct link to Strategy">​</a></h2><p>Thanks to Joe for the insight on how the design working group operates! Back to Ondsel now.</p><p>The strategy here is two-fold. First off, we intend to improve SheetMetal and integrate it into Ondsel ES. This will have to happen in multiple stages.</p><p><strong>Stage 1: Revamp the UI/UX, move the translation to Crowdin.</strong> This is where we are right now. The design working group has already started contributing to the SheetMetal WB. In particular, maxwxyz has already submitted <a href="https://github.com/shaise/FreeCAD_SheetMetal/pull/313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated icons</a> for the workbench to follow the new design guideline, and this change will be part of the next SheetMetal WB release. Both the toolbar reorganization, functions renaming, and switch to using the Task panel will happen here as well.</p><p><strong>Stage 2: Hook up the new materials system.</strong> The existing implementation of materials in the workbench is not very efficient. On top of that, it would be great to be able to use different types of materials (think parametric cardboard designs).</p><p><strong>Stage 3: Rewrite the unfolder in C++ and get it included in FreeCAD core.</strong> This is one of the major takeaways of the technical review. As of today, unfolding is rather slow and would benefit from being written in a more performant programming language such as C++.</p><p><strong>Stage 4: Rewrite the SheetMetal WB to use the core unfolder.</strong> Once the unfolder has been rewritten and moved to FreeCAD, we can go on and rewrite the workbench to use it.</p><p>While we are going to make SheetMetal part of the core Ondsel ES experience, we think upstream FreeCAD should consider the same thing. We also want this project to serve as an example of how core upstream developers, commercial development, the design working group, and addon developers can work together to achieve a common goal. </p><p>We know from the user survey that addons are an important part of meeting user needs. We know from personal experience that addon developers are building great functionality but don’t always have the skills or resources to fully develop it for production use. We believe that the larger community should regularly evaluate how addons are being used.  Work to identify functionality that has a broad appeal and then work to make the addon feel like part of the core experience both in functionality and in how it is maintained.  </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next" title="Direct link to What’s next">​</a></h2><p>The design working group isn’t huge, so there’s enough work for everybody to improve FreeCAD and addons. If you feel like you have great expertise in UI/UX to lend, please join the <a href="https://discord.gg/8UTs35WE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a> and chat to people in the #design-working-group room. If you want to contribute to improving the SheetMetal workbench’s source code, you can already pick some tasks in the <a href="https://github.com/shaise/FreeCAD_SheetMetal/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue tracker</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even calm and steady professionals can get to the point where they’ve just had enough. And for many architects out there, having to use Autodesk Revit on a daily basis is really that kind of a frustrating experience.</p><p>Revit is what most architects learn at school and then use at work. To give credit where credit is due, it has many fine points. You don’t get to be #1 if you don’t get the job done. However, it’s really slow, there are data intellectual property concerns, the subscription price is rising year over year, Autodesk management doesn’t seem to have a coherent vision for the product’s future and they don’t listen to customers nearly as much as they should have, and that’s not even the entire list of issues.</p><p>In this post, we’ll focus on just one aspect of this love-hate relationship: interoperability. Let’s talk about IFC and why Autodesk should take notes from emerging free and open-source tools for building information modeling (BIM) authoring.</p><p>This post was written in collaboration with Yorik van Havre, maintainer of the Arch and BIM workbenches. To add context to this article, we’ve also included insights from Ryan Schultz, a US-based architect with 20+ of experience, founder of <a href="http://openingdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpeningDESIGN</a> and active member of the <a href="https://osarch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OSArch</a> community.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ifc-bim">IFC? BIM?<a href="#ifc-bim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to IFC? BIM?" title="Direct link to IFC? BIM?">​</a></h2><p>If you are new to the topic, here is a quick introduction. In “traditional” architecture you have multiple plans of a building. Structural engineers have their own plan, and so do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical,_electrical,_and_plumbing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MEP</a> engineers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating,_ventilation,_and_air_conditioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HVAC</a> people. And because plans go through revisions, they don’t necessarily match by the time construction starts. And so you could get issues like beams going through ductwork (not great at all), electric wires running near water pipes (really messed up), or natural gas pipes interfering with ventilation ducts (‘holy mother of god’ bad). Which sounds like a comic exaggeration except when it’s not.</p><p>Building information modeling, or BIM for short, is a design methodology that assumes having a full model of a building, both geometric data (walls, slabs, ceiling etc.) and all the engineering systems. This allows analyzing the full model for clashes like the ones mentioned above. It’s <a href="https://bimcorner.com/benefits-of-using-bim-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a lot more than that</a> though. Because it’s all one model, there’s easier generation of bill of materials, finer cost calculation, better scheduling of the life cycle etc., but above all — better communication between all involved parties.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Gantt chart generation" src="/assets/images/gantt-a316e03498b636958558ada8b4325b8a.webp" width="2000" height="1013" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This is where the Industry Foundation Classes standard, or IFC, becomes important. It’s the way you exchange project data between collaborators, especially when they use a different BIM authoring program like ArchiCAD or Tekla Structures.</p><p>IFC is first and foremost a data schema that describes what kind of information can be represented, what metadata can be attached to that information, and how different bits of information are connected to each other. As demands grow, the IFC schema changes over time, with each major revision including something new. So BIM software has to adapt.</p><p>Somewhat confusingly, there is no single file format for IFC. It’s many file formats that represent the same information in different ways, each suitable for a particular application. Perhaps, the most commonly used file format is IFC-SPF. It’s a text format based on STEP as defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISO 10303-21</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-up-with-revits-interoperability-and-ifc-support">What’s up with Revit’s interoperability and IFC support?<a href="#whats-up-with-revits-interoperability-and-ifc-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s up with Revit’s interoperability and IFC support?" title="Direct link to What’s up with Revit’s interoperability and IFC support?">​</a></h2><p>For Revit and other similar BIM authoring applications, there are two major workflows that involve exchanging data and IFC. The less popular workflow is exchanging full models, which only works for smaller projects. The more popular workflow is exporting one part of the entire project to IFC, handing it over to e.g. a MEP engineer, then getting back the revision and linking that file in the master project.</p><p>For the company that actually kickstarted IFC back in 1994, Autodesk is handling its support in a rather unusual way. IFC linking and exporting in Revit is implemented as an <a href="https://github.com/Autodesk/revit-ifc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source plugin</a> that has been available for over a decade. Releases are regular, they are managed by an Autodesk employee, but a large part of development is still done by the person who wrote the original code in his Autodesk years and then went to work at a different company. It’s not a terribly active project either:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Commits to revit-ifc git repo as per OpenHub data" src="/assets/images/revit-ifc-commits-a7806f61f083eed9aafa7ae8105208b5.webp" width="1748" height="545" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Nor is there a lot of active contributors:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="revit-ifc contributors as per OpenHub data" src="/assets/images/revit-ifc-contributors-07f591ad1f9123a37d430349fb6c898d.webp" width="1748" height="843" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Revit-ifc is not a code dump, but it doesn’t have great leadership either. Of course, there could be a case made for the availability of the source code for modifying and distribution (LGPL 2.1). After all, if regular open-source projects are allowed to say “if you don’t like it, patch it” (which tends to be frowned upon), doesn’t it apply to Autodesk as well? But if you are an architecture bureau that pays a hefty, ever-increasing subscription fee to a software vendor, doing the vendor’s job is likely not on your TOP10 list of things to do.</p><p>The net outcome is that Revit’s interoperability with other applications is not great, to put it mildly. It was one of the main subjects raised by architects in multiple open letters in 2020 and 2022.</p><p>The <a href="https://letters-to-autodesk.com/letter-to-autodesk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original open letter</a>, signed in 2020 by <a href="https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/big-name-architects-hit-out-at-cost-and-performance-of-revit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some of the big companies</a> in Great Britain, mentioned “insufficient interoperability between programs, especially when exchanging IFC” and then requested “a commitment to continuously improving <!-- -->[..]<!-- --> industry interoperability (including IFC) as well as expanding geometry support and alignment to international data standards”.</p><p>To Autodesk’s credit, they <a href="https://adsknews.autodesk.com/en/views/reply-to-open-letter-on-revit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a> they could have done a much better job and started more actively engaging with customers.</p><p>Two years later, an <a href="https://letters-to-autodesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">update</a> of the open letter was published. While the authors applauded the creation of a <a href="https://blogs.autodesk.com/aec/roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public roadmap</a> and other changes, they also felt that the company wasn’t interested in foundational changes:</p><blockquote><p>The feeling remains that Autodesk has deliberately avoided investment in appropriate tools, instead expanding their compliance staffing and revenues. … The need remains for a strategic re-boot in order to create a platform that is fit for purpose for the interoperable design and delivery of the next generation of global projects. Clearly this is a difficult thing to do whilst tied to the RVT file format.</p></blockquote><p>This sentiment was largely shared by a large group of architects from Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland, who wrote <a href="https://the-nordic-letter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Nordic Letter</a> (signed by 326 architectural bureaus representing over 14,000 architects) also in 2022. The authors of The Nordic Letter went even further, citing insufficient interoperability between Autodesk’s own products, Revit and Civil 3D:</p><blockquote><p>The experience, however, is that interoperability and subsequent workflow between these two Autodesk owned programs is poor to say the least, requiring several workarounds just to be able to exchange vital project data.</p></blockquote><p>So it seems like a substantial part of the global community feels like Autodesk isn’t interested in investing into interoperability, even if we are talking about its own products.</p><blockquote><p>As a user you can drum the beat about wanting a certain feature. But if the company doesn’t want to do it, your hands are tied. However with open-source, the more drumbeats you have, the more users say “we want this”, the more likely it is that you can organize financing for development of a feature. It’s a beautiful feedback loop — Ryan Schultz</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="native-ifc-and-foss">Native IFC and FOSS<a href="#native-ifc-and-foss" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Native IFC and FOSS" title="Direct link to Native IFC and FOSS">​</a></h2><p>So how do emerging free and open-source BIM authoring tools change this picture?</p><p>The important thing to understand here is that proprietary BIM authoring applications are not IFC editors. When they import an IFC file, they convert it to its own document object model. When they export an IFC file, they convert internal representation of the building information to STEP geometry and IFC metadata. The consequences of that are multifold.</p><p>First of all, they insert vendor-specific metadata that effectively creates a superset of the standard. This metadata doesn’t travel well across BIM authoring applications. And then some non-specific data gets lost because of roundtripping errors.</p><p>Secondly, there’s <a href="https://wiki.osarch.org/index.php?title=Revit_setup_for_OpenBIM/Revit_and_IFC_classes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a lot of extra work</a> involved to create a mapping between IFC classes and Revit objects when importing and exporting.</p><p>And lastly, you can’t have a workflow with atomic changes between revisions. And the latter means that you can’t easily locate the difference between two data points or, better yet, make a sensible visualization of changes. This is one of those cases where something is technically correct to do, but really isn’t helpful at all.</p><p>And it’s precisely where free and open-source applications are beginning to show their teeth, because <a href="https://blenderbim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlenderBIM</a> and FreeCAD are switching to the <a href="https://github.com/brunopostle/ifcmerge/blob/main/docs/whitepaper.rst" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Native IFC methodology</a>.</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:1rem"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ooh05WF__80" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0"></iframe></div><p>In a nutshell, Native IFC is a way for a BIM authoring application to introduce extremely small changes to pre-existing IFC files. The basic rules are simple:</p><ul><li>Never change ID of an IFC entity when you edit its attributes </li><li>If you remove an entity, don’t reuse its numeric ID </li><li>Always write entities in the same format that was already used in the IFC file</li></ul><p>All that means that original data is mangled as little as possible. Which allows putting IFC files into a version control system. And <em>that</em>, in return, makes it possible to create sensible diffs between revisions and perform audit (<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">git blame</a>).</p><blockquote><p>There’s a lot of potential in being able to pull, review, and merge someone else’s changes, although very few people in architecture do it right now. If the software industry was more like the AEC industry, everyone in the IT industry would be in their own silos — unable to share the true fidelity of their code with each other. — Ryan Schultz</p></blockquote><p>And because both BlenderBIM and FreeCAD rely on the <a href="https://ifcopenshell.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IfcOpenShell</a> library, they write geometry and metadata the same standard-compliant way. Which means that you can exchange data between users of both applications and get atomic, trackable changes that can be visualized. BlenderBIM already comes with <a href="https://github.com/brunopostle/ifcmerge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IfcMerge</a>, a tool by Bruno Postle for managing IFC files in a git repository, and an initial implementation of a visual difference visualization:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="BlenderBIM, visual diffing" src="/assets/images/blenderbim-1-1ab482f982b3fc0d419884058a27588a.webp" width="1366" height="768" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The implementation has some issues, but unless we are missing something, this is pretty much the first visual diff tool for IFC in the entire industry, proprietary applications included.</p><p>As a BIM authoring application, BlenderBIM is growing at an incredible pace and comes with both architecture and MEP tools, has means for planning, cost calculation, generation of 2D documentation, its own materials library etc.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="BlenderBIM, MEP tools" src="/assets/images/blenderbim-2-3329ed2ae33c5bb90e222a0a3332d6bb.webp" width="1920" height="1055" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>And, which is also important for architectural visualization, BlenderBIM is built on top of Blender with its rich 3D animation and rendering capabilities.</p><p>FreeCAD’s <a href="https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/FreeCAD-NativeIFC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NativeIFC module</a> is a work in progress. This project is being worked on by Yorik van Havre, original Arch and BIM workbenches developer. His work is sponsored by the <a href="https://opentoolchain.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Toolchain Foundation</a> and <a href="https://nlnet.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NLnet Foundation</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="NativeIFC in FreeCAD" src="/assets/images/native-ifc-freecad-b50dd26257a5be526d21ea2868ba7dca.webp" width="1917" height="1008" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>While BlenderBIM has already switched to using IFC-SPF as a native file format instead of .blend, Yorik’s approach is slightly different. Once the module has been merged, you will have two options. FreeCAD will be able to open IFC files directly and save back to them, but it will also be able to store original IFC data in a container inside a regular FreeCAD file.</p><p>The Native IFC module also plugs into FreeCAD’s existing set of architecture modeling tools that have already been used in production in smaller projects.</p><p>While neither project is currently polished enough to be used for a large-scale architecture project on a deadline, their foundation is exactly what 21st century BIM authoring tools should be based on. They are treating IFC the way it's supposed to be treated. And with a solid foundation like that, getting mature is a ‘when’, not an ‘if’.</p><hr><p>Screenshots courtesy by Dion Moult (BlenderBIM) and Yorik van Havre (FreeCAD)</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the last post in the series where we discuss the takeaways from our recent user research. We already looked at <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-user-survey-results-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">basic demographics data</a> and the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-user-survey-results-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use of 3rd-party addons</a> for getting a job done. Now it’s time to talk about things that annoy users so much they are willing to pay to get these issues nuked from orbit.</p><p>Note: as a for-profit company, we are certainly interested in knowing what users are willing to pay for. If we’re going to survive, we have to do that.  But that was not our primary motivation in asking these specific questions. FreeCAD is not only free-as-in-speech, it’s also free-as-in-beer.  We wanted to know if that was the main reason that people use it. </p><p>Our thinking is that if users are willing to sacrifice financially to make the software better, then it means they value the ‘free-as-in-freedom’ aspect of FreeCAD even more. It would give us confidence that we can build a business model that gives users real value and is also financially sustainable. We were blown-away by the results.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-the-pain-is">Where the pain is<a href="#where-the-pain-is" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Where the pain is" title="Direct link to Where the pain is">​</a></h2><p>We started the last series of questions in the survey with measuring users’ satisfaction with the feature set, UI/UX, and then non-technical parts of the project like docs and community. Let’s have a look.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Features, hobby vs pro" src="/assets/images/features-hobby-vs-pro-b5d2a266077d1562e158deb46f85ff0e.webp" width="1278" height="812" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The situation is not too bad feature-wise. There is a very obvious and somewhat predictable dissatisfaction of pro users with what FreeCAD is capable of.</p><p>The UI/UX response is substantially different though, the largest group sits exactly in the middle between “Not satisfied” and “Very satisfied”, and the number of people who are not satisfied at all is substantially larger than that of people who are completely satisfied with FreeCAD’s UI/UX:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="UX/UI, hobby vs pro" src="/assets/images/ux-ui-hobby-vs-pro-cef7a4b90d29071c53aad7286ff00b55.webp" width="1278" height="812" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Then when we look at satisfaction with non-technical aspects of the project, we see that users are not completely happy with what they got, but they are mostly in the “OK” and “good enough” categories, so, again, not bad at all!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Non-technical aspects, hobby vs pro" src="/assets/images/non-technical-hobby-vs-pro-7c24d1c6ff30d1fadd00950682a2abe4.webp" width="1307" height="812" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We also looked at how that data looks when stacked against other data. Seems like the more time people spend using FreeCAD, the more they are fine with both features and UI/UX.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Satisfaction vs duration of use" src="/assets/images/satisfaction-vs-duration-of-use-d61c458f1aac103dd6074accc319c0fd.webp" width="1137" height="809" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Finally, to figure out what’s most painful for users, we asked them: “What would you be willing to spend money on to see improved?”. We got 517 responses (out of 650 overall). A small number of responses were negative — people were either unwilling to pay for features and fixes in a free and open-source project, couldn’t afford it, or simply didn’t give us their reasons. The overall split is in favor of donating:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Will donate vs will not donate" src="/assets/images/will-or-will-not-donate-44bace381fcb05402521fca9ae9c4280.webp" width="1198" height="674" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Now, here is an interesting question: are professionals more likely to pay for improvements in FreeCAD? Because of the 45/55 split between hobbyists and professionals, we measured this in percentages rather than in absolute numbers. The answer is a definite ‘yes’, but hobbyists feel almost as much involved.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Users willing to pay, hobby vs pro" src="/assets/images/paying-hobby-vs-pro-cede2c5193f0ebf08bacdc1da8de1388.webp" width="1089" height="674" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>494 out of 650 people mentioned various causes they would choose for donating. Sometimes it would be just one thing, sometimes it would be multiple things. If one person mentions UI/UX, Assembly, and CAM, all three get one vote each. We distributed all replies across a dozen categories.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="What to pay for, no split" src="/assets/images/what-pay-for-no-split-b6a31cae267c271c92ded7b5f723cafe.webp" width="1240" height="742" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>To get a better sense of who’s requesting what, we also looked at how those votes are distributed between hobby and pro users.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="What to pay for, hobby vs pro" src="/assets/images/hobby-pro-split-53bf25df910cf229261ca11de0b34c5d.webp" width="1766" height="1093" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="key-takeaways">Key takeaways<a href="#key-takeaways" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key takeaways" title="Direct link to Key takeaways">​</a></h2><p>Over 75% of users surveyed said they were willing to spend money to improve it.  That’s an amazing number.  It speaks volumes about how important the software is to people. It also means these complaints aren’t just people whining. These things affect them and their work significantly.</p><p>Our goal here was to discover what irritates users so much that they are willing to put money where their mouth is.</p><p>Overall, people are really concerned about UI/UX. We’ve done some work on that in Sketcher (that we are proud of), more changes have already landed or are coming from community members, in particular, from the established design working group. There is a lot more to be done, but this is progress!</p><p>Assembly remains #2 popular concern, and we are happy that the integrated assembly workbench is shaping up nicely to address that.</p><p>Toponaming and SheetMetal are almost equally important to users — this is really interesting, we already covered the importance of SheetMetal in the previous post. Both are currently being worked on by community members.</p><p>We found that professionals are relatively less concerned about toponaming in comparison to hobbyists — a point some users are very vocal about on the forum. But pro users are also less concerned about UI/UX than hobbyists are — this is actually interesting.</p><p>On the other hand, professionals are more concerned about CAM, TechDraw, user documentation, FEM, and Arch/IFC than hobbyists are. In fact, pro users are about as much concerned about FEM as they are about TNP, SheetMetal, or TechDraw! So it’s good that there is some activity there lately — thanks to Mario Passaglia who is working on electromagnetic simulations via an FPA grant, as well as to NewJoker who contributes with both code and management.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-this-means-for-you">What this means for you<a href="#what-this-means-for-you" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What this means for you" title="Direct link to What this means for you">​</a></h2><p>FreeCAD has a lot of problems, many of which are serious and will take concerted effort over a long time to solve. But users value the project enough to be ready to financially support the development. Some of the replies we got from the respondents have actual dollar value attached to features and fixes they are missing.</p><p>If you find yourself in agreement with our data and want to see FreeCAD improved and are willing to act on it, you have two options.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-freecad-project-associations-grant-program">The FreeCAD Project Association’s <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fpadf-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grant program</a>.<a href="#the-freecad-project-associations-grant-program" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-freecad-project-associations-grant-program" title="Direct link to the-freecad-project-associations-grant-program">​</a></h3><p>The FPA is continuing to improve its processes for funding development. This is a good thing. It’s already bringing important improvements to Sketcher, FEM, and other parts of the program. This program will expand as donations increase, so giving here means the FPA can tackle more projects at the same time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-ondsel-product-ondsel-es--lens">The Ondsel Product <a href="https://ondsel.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ondsel ES &amp; Lens</a><a href="#the-ondsel-product-ondsel-es--lens" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-ondsel-product-ondsel-es--lens" title="Direct link to the-ondsel-product-ondsel-es--lens">​</a></h3><p>There are some problems, however, that are difficult to solve with one-off grants and part-time developers.  We started Ondsel with the desire to hire full-time professionals to work on FreeCAD as a career.  We think this is essential for the long-term sustainability of the project and the resolution of the most intractable problems. If you agree with what Ondsel does, you can help make more improvements possible by using Ondsel's version of FreeCAD and subscribing to a paid tier. You’ll get advanced features, a polished user experience, and faster updates. And you’ll help us build FreeCAD into a world class engineering suite for everyone.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ondsel is committed to improving the user experience and we spend a lot of time listening to our users.  We often hear the same suggestions and complaints that we’ve heard before but sometimes we get surprised. One of those surprises came out of our recent <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-user-survey-results-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user survey</a>.</p><p>Some users were surprised to learn that FreeCAD has a CAM workbench.  Even though Path has been part of the core FreeCAD experience for more than nine years, it seems many users didn’t know about it.</p><p>We dug a little deeper to understand this and the mystery is simply one of naming; users were confused by the name ‘Path’.</p><p>That’s understandable.  The word ‘path’ is horribly overloaded in FreeCAD.  In some parts of the application a ‘path’ is what you use to sweep a shape along.  In other parts it refers to an operating system file path. Users coming to FreeCAD from other applications expect the functionality to be called ‘CAM’ for Computer Aided Manufacturing.</p><p>Ondsel has taken the lead to resolve this problem.
We <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/12560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opened an issue</a> and invited a comment and then <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12665" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">did the work to rename the workbench</a>.
Users of the FreeCAD weekly builds or Onsel’s pre-release build should see the change soon.</p><h1>Why was FreeCAD’s CAM module named ‘Path’ anyway?</h1><p>Path was started in 2015.  At the time, there had already been an attempt to write a CAM workbench.  The effort had gone cold but wasn’t completely abandoned.  The older workbench was incompatible with the new effort so we chose the name ‘Path’ to avoid confusion and conflict.  In the subsequent years, the Path workbench started getting lots of contributions and grew quickly.  The old CAM workbench got completely abandoned and eventually removed from the source tree entirely.</p><h1>Why change the name now?</h1><p>With the old workbench removed, there’s no longer a conflict over the name.  FreeCAD is getting close to a 1.0 release and changing the name after that will be even more difficult.</p><h1>What to expect</h1><p>Changing a workbench name isn’t technically difficult but it presents some unavoidable complications.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bugs">Bugs<a href="#bugs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bugs" title="Direct link to Bugs">​</a></h3><p>Changing the workbench name means changing the text string in many different places.  While we’ve taken pains to do this as methodically as possible, it possible -even likely- that we missed some instances or made other mistakes.  These bugs should be trivial to fix but extreme edge cases might crop up for some time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="documentation">Documentation<a href="#documentation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Documentation" title="Direct link to Documentation">​</a></h3><p>Changing documentation that the FreeCAD project controls is pretty easy but published books, videos, tutorials, and other content will be obsolete.  Users searching on YouTube for ‘FreeCAD CAM workbench’ won’t see existing content that refers to the old name.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="social-media-channels">Social media channels<a href="#social-media-channels" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Social media channels" title="Direct link to Social media channels">​</a></h3><p>Path has had an active community of users and developers on many different platforms.  Discord, the FreeCAD forum, and others have dedicated channels that will have to be renamed to avoid confusion in the long run but renaming will cause confusion in the short term.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="translation">Translation<a href="#translation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Translation" title="Direct link to Translation">​</a></h3><p>The translation system relies on ‘context strings’ to group text for translation.  When the workbench name and the related commands change names, many of the context strings also change.  This will present some extra work for translators to catch up so translations in some languages may lag for a bit.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="user-macros">User Macros<a href="#user-macros" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to User Macros" title="Direct link to User Macros">​</a></h3><p>If users have written scripts that use the old path commands, those scripts will break.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FreeCAD has been designed as an extensible CAE platform from the ground up. There are currently more than 200 addons available through the Addon Manager alone, ranging from large workbenches to simple macros designed to do one job.</p><p>As part of the user survey, we looked into the use of addons. This is the second part of the series. If you missed it, you can also read what we found about <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-user-survey-results-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user demographics</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-addons-landscape">The addons landscape<a href="#the-addons-landscape" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The addons landscape" title="Direct link to The addons landscape">​</a></h2><p>We first looked at the percentage of people who rely on 3rd-party addons to do their job. This is a nearly 40/60 split: 40.6% absolutely need addons, while 59.4% do just fine without them.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Dependence on addons" src="/assets/images/dependence-on-addons-c8f985dcac475bb8407e7c61f733e387.webp" width="1089" height="675" class="img_ev3q">
With almost 60% of users making do without addons at all, it suggests that the core product is powerful and capable. The rest of the users need something that isn't in the core and we wanted to know what that is.</p><p>We asked users what addons in particular they use. Here is a more verbose chart that lists most common options out of the 111 that users listed. This is consistent with our previous conclusion that the FreeCAD user base is incredibly diverse.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Addons ungrouped" src="/assets/images/addons-ungrouped-040d5bcf5b73d4dc959a019fdd228ae2.webp" width="1090" height="674" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>A few addons like Fasteners and Sheetmetal stand out reflecting their overall popularity but we also saw some redundancy.  We grouped related addons together to see if we could spot some patterns.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Addons grouped" src="/assets/images/addons-pie-5e97db91ce8dad18ab1ddd8d3170800b.webp" width="1090" height="674" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Assembly addons are the largest group followed by NURBS-related addons. Seeing FCGear and Lattice2 in TOP10 (when grouped) is also an eye-opener.</p><p>Let’s quickly focus on two of the groups in the previous pie chart.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="assembly-workbenches">Assembly workbenches<a href="#assembly-workbenches" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Assembly workbenches" title="Direct link to Assembly workbenches">​</a></h2><p>Here is how the “Assembly-related” group breaks down:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Assembly related workbenches" src="/assets/images/assembly-related-4c56dace85978ba2da22f2fb725bb248.webp" width="1090" height="675" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Note that nearly a quarter of respondents didn’t specify the specific assembly workbench they rely on, we don’t know how those 26.7% are distributed across the three actively developed 3rd-party workbenches.</p><p>The overall interest in assemblies is hardly surprising, and since the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research last year</a> we did expect a split between available options. After all, they all have their pros and cons:</p><ul><li>A2plus is easy to get started with, but has less features than A3 and is prone to the toponaming issue.</li><li>A3 has more features but is also harder to master and prone to the toponaming issue unless used as part of the LinkStage fork of FreeCAD by RealThunder.</li><li>A4 works around the toponaming limitations nicely and has some interesting features, but has a convoluted workflow, especially for beginners.</li></ul><p>We expect that the new integrated assembly workbench will appeal mainly to users who stayed away from using existing options due to analysis paralysis, as well as to users who mastered one of the existing workbenches but weren’t really happy with what they got. All three 3rd-party options have users who are dedicated enough to stick with their choice going forward.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nurbs-workbenches">NURBS workbenches<a href="#nurbs-workbenches" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to NURBS workbenches" title="Direct link to NURBS workbenches">​</a></h2><p>Going forward, it’s interesting that people use three different NURBS-related workbenches: Curves, Surface, and Silk.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="NURBS-related workbenches" src="/assets/images/nurbs-related-b4a640547efe84768831082843d10778.webp" width="1090" height="675" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>There are some users who use more than one NURBS workbench, but the overlap isn’t huge: 4 people use Curves and Surface, 2 people use Curves and Silk, 1 person uses Silk and Surface, and the same 1 person uses all three.</p><p>Overall, the NURBS situation is very similar to that of assembly workbenches: useful features are spread across numerous addons. Are we serving users well by keeping things as they are? It’s entirely possible that there should be more consolidation. We think more research is needed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="takeaways">Takeaways<a href="#takeaways" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Takeaways" title="Direct link to Takeaways">​</a></h2><p>Much of what we find in this data just confirms what we already know. But some of it is surprising and puzzling. There's a lot more we can learn from how users are building and using addons. When addons like Lattice2 and KiCADStepUp show unexpected popularity, we need to understand whether it reflects a missing core feature or a different demographic of our users than we thought.</p><p>We also need to keep track which addons users rely on and what they use them for. If a particular addon is really popular with many different kinds of users, that’s a good reason to sit down and evaluate whether it should be part of the core user experience.</p><p>SheetMetal is a good example of that. Its popularity is hardly surprising as this functionality is typically built into proprietary options, and approx. 90% of respondents are familiar with at least one other CAD program (going as far as 6-10 other applications).</p><p>With that in mind, we are working with the SheetMetal workbench developer to get this fundamental tool incorporated directly into FreeCAD rather than as an addon. To ensure integration and functionality are implemented properly, we have reached out to FreeCAD's Design Group to conduct a UX review and begin the process of a long-term strategy towards integrating SheetMetal into FreeCAD. They’ve already done amazing work towards that goal and we look forward to seeing their findings and recommendations.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next?<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next?" title="Direct link to What’s next?">​</a></h2><p>In the next installment in the series we’ll look into the features that FreeCAD users need so much they are willing to pay for. Stay tuned!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month, we ran a user survey to better understand who FreeCAD users are: how they use FreeCAD, what they do at work, what major gripes with the software they have, and more. Over the course of one week, 650 people answered our questions and provided extended insights. They learned about the survey and came to it from more than ten different websites and social media platforms.</p><p>We combined that data with information we got from other sources, such as YouTube analytics, GitHub downloads data, and membership on various social platforms.</p><p>Our takeaways from studying the results and matching datasets against each other fall under three general categories: demographics, addons ecosystem, major issues users have with FreeCAD. This is the first post in the series, let’s focus on demographics here.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="essential-demographic-data">Essential demographic data<a href="#essential-demographic-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Essential demographic data" title="Direct link to Essential demographic data">​</a></h2><p>Is it possible to estimate the entire user base of FreeCAD at all? It’s not going to be easy. We know the data on all social platforms (as of early February):</p><table><thead><tr><th>Platform</th><th>Count</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>FreeCAD Forum</td><td>51433</td></tr><tr><td>/r/FreeCAD subreddit</td><td>18800</td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn FreeCAD group</td><td>4140</td></tr><tr><td>FreeCAD Facebook Group</td><td>20100</td></tr><tr><td>FreeCAD Powerusers</td><td>4700</td></tr><tr><td>X @freecadnews followers)</td><td>15900</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>115073</td></tr></tbody></table><p>But obviously, there are limitations: there is an overlap between those platforms, some users never follow FreeCAD on those social platforms, and there are inactive forum users and Twitter followers. The forum consistently has more anonymous visitors than registered users active at any time.</p><p>We can also look at downloads:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="downloads vs release" src="/assets/images/downloads-vs-release-296d00327459fa44946606d7629a8b32.webp" width="1175" height="726" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>But we don’t know how many of those downloads are automatic and how many are repeated downloads by the same people. We also don’t know how many users downloaded, tried using it a few times, and then moved on. Nor do we know how many users get their downloads from their Linux distributions.</p><p>The only way to have a better understanding of the user base size is to build a ‘phone home’ feature to tell us if a user sitting on a particular IP address loaded the program at least once in a week (or month). However this likely won’t sit well with many users over privacy concerns. And as this has to be an opt-in feature, it’s possible that most users will not enable it, which will render the collected data useless. So why bother?</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>While we don’t have reliable data about the size of the user base, our educated guess based on downloads and community membership is somewhere between 850K and 1.25 million. </p></div></div><p>We didn’t ask basic questions like age or gender, because we already have this information from YouTube analytics for our channel:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Age and gender per YouTube stats" src="/assets/images/age-gender-d67594a3f08b16a3f41e480490649e43.webp" width="884" height="784" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We discussed this with a few youtubers who run popular channels for FreeCAD users, and the situation is more or less the same: very few student-aged users and older people, almost no women, virtually no 13-17 aged kids.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="who-are-the-users">Who are the users?<a href="#who-are-the-users" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Who are the users?" title="Direct link to Who are the users?">​</a></h2><p>Let’s take a quick look at the following general datasets: “Industries“, “Hobbyists vs pro users”, “Jobs”, and “Making money with FreeCAD”.</p><p>Industries:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Industries" src="/assets/images/industries-283675fd559d3580a78a8ebfa094f0b6.webp" width="1497" height="673" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We combined some of the responses into larger categories:</p><ul><li>Architecture, Construction, Engineering — essentially, everything that has to do with buildings and civil engineering.</li><li>Product Engineering — designing physical products, primarily using mechanical design tools.</li><li>Computing — people working in software development companies as solution architects, developers, consultants etc.</li></ul><p>One thing that we could have done better here is separating “hobby” industries from “pro” industries, because a number of people use FreeCAD both at work and for hobby, and those aren’t necessarily the same industries. Much of the “Other” category is actually all kinds of use for hobbies like woodworking (with CNC), designing small appliances for fun, 3D printing etc.</p><p>Hobbyists vs professionals:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Hobby vs Pro use" src="/assets/images/hobby-vs-pro-e7666b89e1f78de97dc99759558f44fa.webp" width="1087" height="673" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This is somewhat surprising: we had very modest expectations for people using FreeCAD professionally. Actual numbers surpassed our expectations. In hindsight this makes sense. The ‘non-hobby’ group includes users who are using the software professionally as well as those who use it at work but not as their primary role or in a revenue-generating way. For example, researchers and students wouldn’t be in the hobby category but also wouldn’t consider themselves ‘professional’ CAD users. This became clearer when we asked them about making money with FreeCAD.</p><p>Making money with FreeCAD:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Money" src="/assets/images/money-1f32f083b89679e8d94bebe3f31faed2.webp" width="1087" height="673" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We are pleasantly surprised to see that more than one in five users has used FreeCAD to make money.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="experience-with-cad">Experience with CAD<a href="#experience-with-cad" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Experience with CAD" title="Direct link to Experience with CAD">​</a></h2><p>People who have used either lots of other CAD programs or none whatsoever are both minorities. Most users have experience with 1 to 5 other programs:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Other CAD programs" src="/assets/images/other-cad-programs-c677aeaf79b539edffe1d62818e17e6f.webp" width="1368" height="575" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>There is a somewhat expected correlation between experience with other programs and satisfaction with FreeCAD:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Satisfaction vs experience vs other CAD programs" src="/assets/images/satisfaction-vs-experience-c092797aa36ca02ecc6d3b83a284f0c4.webp" width="946" height="730" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>There are two noteworthy things here. First, the feature satisfaction trend line is not as steep as the one for UI/UX satisfaction. This suggests that for experienced users, features are less of a problem as compared to UI/UX.</p><p>Secondly, note that the trend line for “UI/UX satisfaction vs Experience with other CAD” flattens out at 3-5 and actually goes back up a little. It looks like FreeCAD doesn’t stack against competition very well. But some of the users who truly have seen it all are more likely to cut FreeCAD developers some slack.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="takeaways">Takeaways<a href="#takeaways" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Takeaways" title="Direct link to Takeaways">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-user-base-is-highly-diverse-in-industries">The user base is highly diverse in industries<a href="#the-user-base-is-highly-diverse-in-industries" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The user base is highly diverse in industries" title="Direct link to The user base is highly diverse in industries">​</a></h3><p>There’s just no way around it: FreeCAD users are all over the map. This is not a problem per se, but it means that we need to pay a lot of attention to how well FreeCAD works for very different groups of users. For instance, there might be a need for fine-tuning the user experience for architects or mechanical engineers one way or another.</p><p>The survey gave us a glimpse into the variety of uses that FreeCAD gets from its community. We need more and better data on that to make good decisions, feature- and UX-wise.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="people-are-using-freecad-for-real-work">People are using FreeCAD for Real Work™<a href="#people-are-using-freecad-for-real-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to People are using FreeCAD for Real Work™" title="Direct link to People are using FreeCAD for Real Work™">​</a></h2><p>As we have already mentioned, we expected fewer people to be using FreeCAD professionally. It’s a good kind of being wrong, but it also means that we need to prioritize development for professional use. We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: if FreeCAD gets the job done for a professional working on a deadline, it will likely get the job done in the prosumer market as well. In that sense, FreeCAD might not be ready for every professional need, but there are many tasks for which it is a great choice.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="demographic-disparities">Demographic disparities<a href="#demographic-disparities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Demographic disparities" title="Direct link to Demographic disparities">​</a></h2><p>The audience data form YouTube analytics was sampled two weeks after publishing the Ondsel ES 2024.1 video, when there were ca. 20K views of it. Shortly before that video, the 18-24 age range accounted for mere 2% of visitors. Now, a month after that screenshot was taken, this age group is hovering between 8% and 9%.</p><p>The lack of 13-17 kids is not surprising: we upload our videos as not targeted at kids, and so do many other youtubers. No surprises there. But this only accounts for users who would see our videos suggested by the platform. That means that there are also virtually no 13-17 users in the core FreeCAD audience. This is hardly an age-specific thing: so far, there have been over a million 3D printing related videos published on TikTok, accounting for over 18bln views (<a href="https://tiktokhashtags.com/hashtag/3dprinting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>). Is FreeCAD too messy for the younger generation?</p><p>We don’t have survey data supporting the staggering disparity between males and females that we see in YouTube statistics. What we do know is that it’s common for other FreeCAD channels on YouTube, as well as for FOSS-related websites. We also know that women made 16.7% of the engineering workforce in the U.S. in 2023 <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as per U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> — much more than what <em>we</em> see. This kind of disparity <a href="https://www.toptal.com/open-source/is-open-source-open-to-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been studied</a> in other FOSS communities and generally attributed to unwelcoming culture. We don’t know if that’s the case here but it’s worth considering.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-conclusion">In conclusion<a href="#in-conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to In conclusion" title="Direct link to In conclusion">​</a></h2><p>We spent many years trusting our guts instead of studying the community. While some of our assumptions turned out to be right, some of the results challenged our understanding of who FreeCAD users are and what they want.</p><p>Let’s hear your thoughts about the takeaways. Stay tuned for the next post in the series that covers the importance of addons for FreeCAD users!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FOSS projects often struggle to build and follow a coherent development roadmap that lets contributors add new features while also improving code quality, removing deprecated features, and generally improving the application. After all, it’s more fun to work on new features than it is to write unit tests, refactor code, and fix bugs.</p><p>Young projects don’t have much technical debt and usually only have a couple contributors. The code base is small. Most of the people working on it share a common vision and understand how the code serves that purpose. As the project grows and attracts users, contributions come from people who don’t share the original vision. The project may have to choose between accepting a poorly implemented feature or rejecting it and losing a potentially valuable contributor. Technical debt increases and it becomes difficult to make substantial changes.</p><p>Mature projects, in contrast, have built up systems and processes to manage technical debt. But this transition from adolescence to maturity is rough.  FOSS projects that have successfully made that transition share some similarities. They often have a company or a non-profit organization backing the development. They have strong leadership and well defined guidelines for contributions. They also have both software developers and domain experts contributing to the development roadmap.</p><p>The importance of the domain experts can’t be overstated. Sometimes called “product owner”, this person serves a key role. Let’s talk about this role in software projects: why it’s a must in software development in general, why there aren’t many of them in FOSS projects, and what projects like FreeCAD could do to get them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="who-is-a-product-owner">Who is a product owner?<a href="#who-is-a-product-owner" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Who is a product owner?" title="Direct link to Who is a product owner?">​</a></h2><p>The “product vision” is the future state of the product that an organization is bringing to life. It’s the shared goal about where the development is heading. The main job of a product owner (PO) is to maintain the product vision and ensure its consistent implementation.  This sets a number of expectation of a PO:</p><ul><li><strong>Domain expertise.</strong> The product owner needs to be a generalist, someone who follows the industry, knows about new developments, knows what everybody is talking about and why they are talking about it. Deep technical knowledge is  important but so is understanding how a tool gets used in a wide range of contexts.</li><li><strong>Basic understanding of the software development process.</strong> A good PO doesn’t need to be capable of writing great code, but they should be comfortable translating user language to developers language and back. They should also be at home with basic software development methodologies.</li><li><strong>Organization skills.</strong> POs do not manage the development process, but they help organize it and play a major role in setting priorities: what gets developed first and what should wait until the next step.</li></ul><p>Here are some of the things that a product owner might do on a daily basis:</p><ul><li>Talk to users and stakeholders to refine the product vision and document it.</li><li>Clarify feature requests and bug reports to understand <em>why</em> the feature is needed or how a bug is affecting users.</li><li>Make decisions that affect development, such as priority and scope of tasks, as well as trade-offs where they have to keep in mind business value, needs of users, and a variety of constraints.</li><li>Maintain the product backlog and user stories to keep them up-to-date.</li><li>Work with product owners of other applications or other parts of the same application to identify shared goals, communicate priority, find opportunities for collaboration, and avoid risk.</li><li>Manage risks by adjusting priorities, scope of tasks, and allocated resources to support a workable development plan.</li></ul><p>POs tend to have a pretty good grasp of reality: what customers want and — more importantly — what they <em>need</em>. The distinction between “want” and “need” is vital. POs don’t just understand <em>what</em> is important, they understand <em>why</em> it matters and they can explain it.</p><p>While users might be quick to suggest is a new option or feature, implementing everything without a plan results in application bloat, preference creep,  and makes the overall user experience worse. I knowledgable PO will understand what the user needs and will seek ways to meet the need without comprising application quality.  It takes a particular mindset and set of skills to see the real solution and to get a team to build it.</p><p>Product owners work closely with the development team.  The understand the strengths and weaknesses of the team and what each person already has on their plate.  The can help schedule and prioritize tasks so the team can move fast to reach goals. They’re often the first to recognize new talent and expand the organization. They are best positioned to make trade-offs between the changes that users request and the time, budget, and technical debt that the change incurs.</p><p>This means product owners pretty much sit at the junction of UX, technology, and business. That makes them uniquely qualified to guard the vision for the product.</p><p>In a professional development shop, POs play a vital and necessary role and they have a lot of authority. In FOSS projects, this would never work. Such central control doesn’t exist in projects comprised primarily of volunteers. In order to be effective, a PO would need to excel through encouragement, persuasion, and influence. They need to build consensus and be excellent at communicating.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="freecad-has-done-fine-without-product-owners-until-now-why-change">FreeCAD has done fine without product owners until now. Why change?<a href="#freecad-has-done-fine-without-product-owners-until-now-why-change" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to FreeCAD has done fine without product owners until now. Why change?" title="Direct link to FreeCAD has done fine without product owners until now. Why change?">​</a></h2><p>FreeCAD has historically had maintainers who each oversee a workbench or a functional area. They coordinate development and collectively have the final word on pull requests. This combines the role of the PO (domain expert) and maintainer (code expert) into one person. This model works reasonably well early but tends to break down when the maintainer leaves the project. It’s easy to see why. The loss of a single person eliminates both domain and code expertise and it is nearly impossible to find someone else capable of assuming the role.</p><p>I can speak from personal experience how difficult it is to maintain a workbench. Even though I’m one of the original authors and current maintainer of the Path (CAM) workbench, I have no professional experience with CNC/CAM. I lack deep domain expertise.   While I get lots of support from our power users, I still struggle to know what features we should build and in what order. As maintainer of Path, I would  welcome a product owner to help establish a vision and organize us to build it.</p><p>Apart from Path, another example is the FEM workbench. Most contributions lately are coming from <em>marioalexis84</em> who now has a grant from the FreeCAD Project Association to work on electromagnetic system simulations. But the workbench currently lacks an active captain.  It needs someone in a leadership position to set priorities straight and attract new contributors. To aid that, <em>NewJoker</em> recently created a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project board</a> for the FEM workbench. We think this could be a great test case for the entire idea of product owners in FreeCAD and we encourage the community to support them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="this-isnt-a-novel-concept">This isn’t a novel concept<a href="#this-isnt-a-novel-concept" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to This isn’t a novel concept" title="Direct link to This isn’t a novel concept">​</a></h2><p>FreeCAD wouldn’t be the first project to organize itself this way. There are some great examples of FOSS projects with product owners that we can learn from.</p><p><strong>MuseScore Studio</strong> (formerly MuseScore) and <strong>Audacity</strong>, both currently under the wing of <a href="https://www.mu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Muse Group</a>. The company originally hired Martin Keary as head of design, who then hired Bradley Kunda to design UX/UI and later promoted him to become the product owner of MuseScore Studio. Bradley played a large role in the v4.0 release in 2022 and supervised the release of v4.1 and v4.2 in 2023 — all with major new features and quality-of-life improvements.</p><p><a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Blender</strong></a> is the darling of the FOSS community but also quite an exception in terms of how everything is organized. They have a physical location where people come to work, and their Studio team of animators and CG artists has direct access to developers — a development model that is rather hard to copy for other projects. Blender divides the project into modules and assign module owners. Module owners are primarily developers, but they also “decide on implementation and design issues <!-- -->[...]<!-- --> and approve or reject patches and feature requests”. While Blender doesn't use the term “product owners”, the important thing is the close working relationship between those responsible for the code and those with deep domain expertise.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-steps">Next steps<a href="#next-steps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next steps" title="Direct link to Next steps">​</a></h2><p>We’re glad to see FreeCAD is starting to take steps in this area and we think the project should go farther and try to identify other areas where product owners could make a positive change by working in parallel with the maintainers.   We’d love to be able to tell you how that should happen, but alas, herein lies the problem.</p><p>There is no good place to have a discussion about how the project should be managed and a roadmap developed. Moreover, there is simply no established process to assign product owners. Even maintainers just “happen”: people do great work, get silently accepted by the community in a leadership role, then someone with enough privileges on GitHub gives them the rights to merge PRs.  Strangely, this bottom-up organic process has worked and might work equally well for product owners.</p><p>Ondsel is not calling for a formal structure to be implemented. We’re not asking for product owners to be appointed and rule with an iron fist. We’re suggesting that having people in this role will lead to a different set of conversations. It will lead to a better decision making process and more transparency.  It should lead to less conflict on the forum and better capture of ideas in Github issues.</p><p>This lack of a formal process is less of an issue than not having product owners in the FreeCAD community. Establishing a way to formally elect or appoint POs can happen down the road if having them improves the development process. The first step is to identify people who can do the work and start building trust and procedures that work. There are multiple communication channels: the forum, the Discord server, /r/FreeCAD, various social networks. Let’s have discussions there and see if there’s a general consensus about the following things:</p><ul><li>Who would make good product owners?</li><li>What FreeCAD modules do you think would benefit from a strategic vision?</li><li>What other projects do you think have done it well?</li><li>What can we learn from their experience?</li></ul><p>We’ll watch discussions in these communication channels closely and do another post with takeaways.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are happy to announce the release of Ondsel Engineering Suite 2024.1, our integrated solution for collaboration on 3D CAD designs. </p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:1rem"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x2F1A0MYhMk" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0"></iframe></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introducing-ondsel-es">Introducing Ondsel ES<a href="#introducing-ondsel-es" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introducing Ondsel ES" title="Direct link to Introducing Ondsel ES">​</a></h2><p>Back when we launched Ondsel, we looked at what’s going on with the CAD market and how open-source alternatives can play a role. We came back with several important takeaways:</p><ul><li><strong>Licencing policies of proprietary CAD vendors annoy users to no end.</strong> Even some of the more affordable mainstream 3D CAD solutions, while rather powerful, drive users nuts: more and more limitations to what you can do, vendor lock-in, formerly free features disappearing behind paywalls etc.</li><li><strong>FOSS tools are usually rejected by professional users unless they are mature.</strong> Many users flee from those mainstream CAD platforms to open-source, but they have to deal with various technical limitations, missing features, and general lack of UX/UI polish.</li><li><strong>Collaboration is really important.</strong> A lot of users need a convenient platform to upload and share/visualize a project (vaulting) or even work together on a project (PDM).</li></ul><p>So our thinking was: we should focus on a polished user experience and features that are essential to professional use. Let’s build something we feel good about recommending to someone working on a deadline. And let’s build a service for vaulting and collaboration.</p><p>Enter Ondsel ES. Building on FreeCAD, Ondsel ES is integrated with Ondsel Lens, an online vault for 3D CAD files with elements of a PDM system.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Ondsel ES" src="/assets/images/ondsel-es-intro-ddfeb16de0b97f3000655dbf9692efe3.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Our primary objective is to provide polish and sorely missing features — that’s a large part of the added value. We’ve made big and small changes in the upstream project, but the four vital projects for us have been toponaming, integrated assembly workbench, UX/UI, and collaboration.</p><p>The work on the toponaming problem is an ongoing project, and we are very grateful to the FreeCAD community for contributing a lot to that effort. But it’s not complete yet, there will be much more to say when it’s largely done. So let’s focus on the other three.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="integrated-assembly-workbench">Integrated Assembly workbench<a href="#integrated-assembly-workbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Integrated Assembly workbench" title="Direct link to Integrated Assembly workbench">​</a></h2><p>Ondsel ES is shipping with an early preview of the integrated Assembly workbench that is being built for the upstream project.</p><p>The workbench provides a simple workflow: create new or link existing parts, ground one part, select a joint type, select two geometric features, confirm. That is all it takes to attach one part to another.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Editing joint local system" src="/assets/images/assembly-jcs-editing-c5123022b000f3caee76e03902b1985b.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The Assembly workbench features direct dragging for moving parts around before and after joining them. Within the assembly, there’s no need to use a transform tool. You just grab a part and drag it where it belongs.</p><p>Even though we have been testing the assembly workbench mostly on simple projects, users of the pre-release have been making impressive things and stress-testing it which helps us a lot. The community is simply the best.</p><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Live assembly by Kwahoo" src="/assets/images/kwahoo-6d40a346fe9209982b40920bc00e3ce3.webp" width="1083" height="930" class="img_ev3q">
<a href="https://t.co/UeGP5PVjcr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kwahoo's tweet</a></p><p>Most of the work on the integrated Assembly workbench has been done by Dr. Aik-Siong Koh and Pierre-Louis Boyer, with some contributions from developers in the FreeCAD community. The assembly example project we ship with Ondsel ES originally comes from Jose Gabriel Egas Ortuño.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="uxui-and-sketcher">UX/UI and Sketcher<a href="#uxui-and-sketcher" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to UX/UI and Sketcher" title="Direct link to UX/UI and Sketcher">​</a></h2><p>Before joining Ondsel, Pierre-Louis spent some time developing various improvements for the Sketcher workbench, <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=65521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely supported by the community</a>. With Ondsel backing his work, he completed these patches and got most of them merged into the upstream project. You can try them for yourself today in Ondsel ES.</p><p><strong>Smart dimensioning.</strong> Once you select two geometric features, the Dimension tool will figure out what the most applicable constraint for that combination is and apply it. This new tool effectively replaces half a dozen separate constraint tools: horizontal and vertical distance, distance, radius, diameter, angle. You can pretty much dimension an entire sketch with just one tool.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/smart-dimensions.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p><strong>Floating input widgets help quickly constraining sketches.</strong> When you have a pretty good idea of what you are drafting and what all the dimensions are, this new way of drawing a sketch is a huge productivity booster. Select a tool, hover the mouse pointer over canvas and input numbers, press <strong>Tab</strong> to go from one parameter to the next one.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Floating input widgets in Sketcher" src="/assets/images/floating-input-widgets-79604402dfe07b9dd01067790a220b34.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Tool settings reduce toolbar bloat and introduce new features.</strong> Now you can easily enable/disable the rounding of rectangles, set how many sides you want in a polygon, or which method you use to construct an arc — all instead of extra buttons.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Tool parameters in Sketcher" src="/assets/images/tool-parameters-6a6c77a0e9f5af7a347c9f518f29e8aa.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Automatic horizontal/vertical constraint tool.</strong> This new tool helps fixing sketches where straight lines are not quite horizontal or vertical. You can use it to point and click on the lines of interest, or you can pre-select entire shapes and then click on the tool to automatically apply contextually relevant constraints.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/auto-hor-vert-constraint.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p><strong>More sketching tools: Translates, Rotate, Scale, Offset.</strong> It’s what users have been asking for since the early days of Sketcher. The tools are finally available and do just what it says on the label and then some. For instance, the <em>Rotate</em> tool has a <em>Copies</em> option that allows creating polar patterns.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Rotate / Polar Patterns" src="/assets/images/rotate-polar-patterns-0cba199089a7d1ee010dd41ea32756ea.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Copying and pasting in Sketcher.</strong> Now you can select geometry in Sketcher and cut or copy and paste it using conventional shortcuts or the main menu.</p><p>As for <strong>overall UX/UI improvements</strong>, the default user interface theme used by Ondsel ES is <a href="https://github.com/obelisk79/OpenTheme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenDark</a>, a project by Joe Sardos aka "Obelisk". This seems to be a popular customnization choice among users, so we went with it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="collaboration-with-ondsel-lens">Collaboration with Ondsel Lens<a href="#collaboration-with-ondsel-lens" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Collaboration with Ondsel Lens" title="Direct link to Collaboration with Ondsel Lens">​</a></h2><p>Ondsel ES integrates with Lens — our digital vault for your 3D CAD files, with elements of a product data management (PDM) system. You can upload and explore 3D CAD designs, create multiple workspaces for yourself or for your collaborators.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" style="max-width:100%" src="https://lens.ondsel.com/share/65af04b361821ca0c25d2afc" title="Ondsel"></iframe><p>Lens will be available in three tiers to meet the most common user needs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="solo">Solo<a href="#solo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Solo" title="Direct link to Solo">​</a></h3><p>This is the free tier of Lens. It’s a great way to experiment with what a PDM system does without spending a lot of money. In the solo tier, all designs that you upload are public. If you’re working on a project that you want to share or where privacy isn’t a concern, the solo tier may be all you need. Simply upload an FCStd or an OBJ file, create a public link, and share it wherever you like. Your shared model will also appear in <a href="https://lens.ondsel.com/public-models" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the public gallery</a>. </p><p>We implemented link unfurling in Lens, so social networks that also support unfurling should be able to render a preview of your model in a post. And if you are a member of the FreeCAD forum, Lens is a convenient place to store models that you want to embed in your posts. Or you could embed your models on a website or an online shop.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Share Model options" src="/assets/images/share-model-bee97405cf4e7a3763a2bfc1f1d4eaa5.webp" width="2560" height="1285" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="peer">Peer<a href="#peer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Peer" title="Direct link to Peer">​</a></h3><p>If privacy is important or if you need  to control what the viewer is allowed to download, the Peer tier is for you. Specifically designed for professionals who work independently, it provides privacy and control over your models, offers more storage space, and allows for parametric models that can be updated on the server. You can keep project files in the default workspace or organize different projects as multiple workspaces.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Personal workspaces" src="/assets/images/personal-workspaces-3b49fa847e2afe29f9d1fa36ce3525f6.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>When you have something to show your customer or a manufacturer you work with, you can create open links for your private designs and set what types of files are downloadable. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Options for sharing models" src="/assets/images/share-model-options-c197e40824a5eefb8ec920e31bf453bf.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Just because you work independently doesn’t mean you work alone.  We’ve heard from professionals who are collaborating with others on projects that are being built in the ‘open hardware’ model. The Peer tier also allows you to create ‘open’ organizations, invite collaborators, and control write access.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enterprise">Enterprise<a href="#enterprise" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enterprise" title="Direct link to Enterprise">​</a></h3><p>For larger teams working on proprietary designs, we will be introducing the Enterprise tier.  Enterprise gives full control over model visibility, read/write access, and group management. Many more features are planned for the enterprise tier that will make Ondsel a powerful addition to your toolkit.</p><p>Ondsel Lens also has some extras that you do not typically get in affordable 3D CAD vaults.</p><p>For engineers who design inherently customizable things (think <a href="https://gridfinity.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gridfinity</a>), Lens provides a user interface for <strong>custom properties</strong> made with the PropertyBag feature of the Path workbench. This means a user can open someone else’s model in Lens, change some attributes to their liking, then download and 3D-print an STL file.

The same applies to the Lens addon.</p><p>We contribute our changes to the upstream project. The Ondsel team is relatively small, we wouldn’t be able to maintain a hard fork. It’s in our best interests to play fairly with the community.</p><p>Files created by Ondsel ES are FreeCAD files. Anything you create with Ondsel can be opened in FreeCAD and vice versa. This compatibility is important to us and we know it’s important to our users. One caveat: Ondsel ES includes the new Assembly workbench because we think it’s important to get feedback early and to let users build the most common kinds of assemblies that they need. But this workbench functionality is still being reviewed by the upstream project. Assemblies you create in Ondsel can be opened in FreeCAD but will not have the full assembly functionality until the entirety of the workbench has been accepted.</p><p>As for the files that you upload to Lens, your original 3D CAD designs will always remain your property.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next" title="Direct link to What’s next">​</a></h2><p>We expect to spend the next few months polishing features that we have already implemented in both Ondsel ES and Lens, and exploring our next steps based on your feedback, as well as the results of the recent user survey. Some of our immediate plans for Lens include displaying assemblies, ability to control visibility of parts, support for colored bodies.</p><p>There’s an active <a href="https://discord.com/invite/7jmzezyyfP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chat on Discord</a> where many early adopters provide feedback.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’ve completed the first year as employees and contractors paid to hack on FreeCAD and build services around it. We do have a few things to brag about. We also had some setbacks and challenges. Since we started Ondsel with a goal to be as honest and transparent as possible, let’s talk about things the team learned this year while figuring things out.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="being-part-of-the-freecad-community">Being part of the FreeCAD community<a href="#being-part-of-the-freecad-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Being part of the FreeCAD community" title="Direct link to Being part of the FreeCAD community">​</a></h2><p>The majority of the team — employees and contractors alike — was already involved with the FreeCAD project one way or another prior to the launch of Ondsel.</p><p>I was one of the original authors of the Path workbench that I still maintain and I’m one of the founding members of the FreeCAD Project Association. Ajinkya and Amritpal were former GSoC students who continued contributing after the program was over. Pierre contributed to the Sketcher workbench. Pieter created the <a href="https://osh-autodoc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OSH Automated Documentation</a> workbench. Adrian who recently joined us as contractor had been release manager of FreeCAD for the past couple of years. Alex contributed translation updates and covered FreeCAD news in his blog.</p><p>In other words, we understand how the project works and what challenges it faces.</p><p>Ondsel and FreeCAD have a shared interest: making the software great, creating a thriving ecosystem around it, and encouraging more contribution. At the same time, we’re different and our differences provide both opportunity and challenge.  As a startup, Ondsel has to be commercially successful and it absolutely has to hit certain financial goals in a sensible timeframe. On the other hand, Ondsel can do things that would be difficult or impossible for the FreeCAD project to achieve. Things like SaaS collaboration or CAD “vaulting”. We can bring focused development attention to really hard issues like toponaming and we can more effectively respond to the needs of commercial users.</p><p>Our differences also mean that we <em>must</em> operate differently. As a company we need more predictability. If we contribute a fix or a new feature, and it passes code review but never gets merged, our effort and money is wasted.  If we want that change for our own customers then our code base starts becoming a hard fork, and those are difficult to maintain with a small team. We want to build on top of the great FreeCAD foundation. We don’t want to fork it.  Early on, we asked for a more reliable process where the queue of pull requests gets reviewed on a regular basis and changes are acted on quickly. The community responded, and the merge process is now running remarkably well.</p><p>But guess what; It helps the FreeCAD project just as much as it helps us. Contributors don’t really like when their patches are stuck in limbo for years. It hurts morale and drives contributors away. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-worked-well-and-what--not-so-much">What worked well and what — not so much<a href="#what-worked-well-and-what--not-so-much" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What worked well and what — not so much" title="Direct link to What worked well and what — not so much">​</a></h2><p>Some things worked amazingly well. The merge process was definitely a huge win for everybody. The queue of active PRs is now commonly below 25 items.</p><p>The toponaming project is progressing well despite some tasks taking a lot of time, like the ongoing battle of the TopoShape class with its 94 methods and 5,600 lines of code. The team is now in the middle of the third phase of the project.</p><p>The integrated assembly workbench is shaping up really nicely, we are beginning to see users  demonstrating complexity beyond what we expected and reporting bugs and requests for improvement. The initial implementation will be minimal yet functional, with a solid foundation for further expansion.</p><p>Things didn’t go as smoothly with UX/UI fixes. We’ve had some great results with improving major parts of FreeCAD like Sketcher: new tools, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/floating-input-widgets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floating input widgets, tool settings</a>, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/ondsel-made-constraining-sketches-faster-and-easier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">easy dimensioning</a> etc. Unfortunately, UI discussions on the forum and in GitHub issues continue to be emotional and often counterproductive.</p><p>To be honest, we — the entire FreeCAD development community — have done a poor job of talking to our users. Too often we’re asking them how they want us to build the application. That’s the wrong set of questions.  Instead we should be asking them <em>what they want to accomplish</em>. We should be learning why they need the feature they are asking for so we can implement it in a way that makes sense. It isn’t fair to expect our user base and especially our power users to also be experts in software development. That’s not their role in the community.</p><p>FreeCAD was started by software developers who were also experts in CAD. For a long time, the community had many people like this and made great strides but these are rare people.  Now our community is much larger and has people with a diverse set of skills and experience.  Many of them are using FreeCAD to do amazing things but most aren’t software developers.</p><p>As the project continues to mature, we need to embrace this reality.  We need to build up a team of experts who can work effectively with developers.  We need people with vision, patience, and the ability to communicate the WHY of things.  </p><p>The emerging <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-breaking-open-source-ux-curse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design review team</a> in the FreeCAD community as well as Ondsel haven’t yet gained enough trust from the wider community. Building trust takes time.  It requires us to say what we’re going to do and then follow through. It requires us to demonstrate competence and humility at the same time. I believe that FreeCAD v1.0 release will help a lot with trust simply because of all the much anticipated features and quality-of-life changes it will bring.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="exploring-the-viability-of-freecad-as-a-pro-tool">Exploring the viability of FreeCAD as a pro tool<a href="#exploring-the-viability-of-freecad-as-a-pro-tool" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Exploring the viability of FreeCAD as a pro tool" title="Direct link to Exploring the viability of FreeCAD as a pro tool">​</a></h2><p>Over the course of the entire last year, I conducted several dozen interviews with users from all walks of life: hobbyists, freelance engineers, small business owners, CTOs of larger companies. The frustrating part is that it’s pretty damn hard to find people who do commercial work with FreeCAD. This is an existential problem for the FreeCAD project and also for Ondsel. </p><p>Commercial work is all about turnover, efficiency, and stability. When a software project focuses on building for a commercial audience, the resulting application works for commercial users as well as for hobbyists and other enthusiasts. </p><p>Commercial users push development of advanced features and bring resources that can fund that development. But if the project focuses on meeting every niche desire and special case, if it rushes development features that should be more thoroughly investigated and implemented carefully, if it caters exclusively to the enthusiasts, then the result is hard to learn and maintain.  It won’t be adopted by commercial users at all. </p><p>The project is maturing and it’s time to be more focused on building relationships with users that will demand stability and ease of use as well as advanced features.</p><p>In that sense, getting Stephen Hawes from <a href="https://www.opulo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opulo</a> into the FPA general assembly recently was a smart move. Opulo is a small startup that uses FreeCAD extensively to build their Lumen Pick-and-Place machine.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="takeaways">Takeaways<a href="#takeaways" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Takeaways" title="Direct link to Takeaways">​</a></h2><p>What have we learned?</p><p><strong>Faster release cycles and clear release goals benefit everyone.</strong> We’ve seen an overwhelmingly positive community’s response to the idea that releases should be more frequent and more focused. It also helps the developers make decisions based on priorities. It worked well for us in the past, e.g. when we built a release goal around migrating to Qt5 and when we focused on supporting Python 3, for example. These kinds of release goals work.  Let’s do more of them.</p><p><strong>We need more ‘better’ communication.</strong> Both weekly PR review meetings, bi-weekly TNP meetings, and monthly developer meetings were a tremendous success in terms of helping contributors communicate to each other and sync on their plans. Continuing that is a bare minimum.</p><p><strong>We need more ‘high expense’ communication.</strong> When we did the assembly WB review series and offered a path forward, there was very little unproductive discussion. People mostly got on with that. And now the first feedback we are getting is that workflow-wise the integrated assembly workbench is more or less what people had hoped for. But communicating this way is expensive. There’s a lot of research hours put into this project prior to any coding (which is also not cheap). We need more research like that to help unify vision and clarify goals.</p><p><strong>The project needs more trust between stakeholders.</strong> The FreeCAD project has been going through massive changes for the past few years: new faces, new unusual roles, a non-profit organization backing it, the first company building around FreeCAD commercially etc. This is a lot to take in. We need to find a way to communicate better with each other and build stronger relationships to succeed.</p><p><strong>The ‘commercial’ user base of FreeCAD is too small.</strong> The perception among commercial users is that FreeCAD isn’t ready for real work. We think otherwise. Ondsel doesn’t have to be all things to all users. It is perfectly capable of meeting many needs that commercial users have now.  What’s required is a focus on exposing that capability to a wider audience of commercial users and a focus on minimizing the weaknesses as fast as possible. If we want FreeCAD to excel, we need to talk to people who use CAD programs for work, and we need to do it all the time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next?<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next?" title="Direct link to What’s next?">​</a></h2><p>Our plan is to release a build of FreeCAD that is targeted at commercial users — with more polish all around and an initial version of the integrated assembly workbench, as well as with collaboration and sharing tools.</p><p>We have more interviews already scheduled and we’ll continue listening to users — those who succeeded using FreeCAD for work and those who struggled and chose something else instead. We’ll also invest more time into strengthening our relationship with the FreeCAD community.</p><p>For now, you can <a href="https://ondsel.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grab the latest Ondsel build</a> of FreeCAD, give it a spin and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/7jmzezyyfP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join our Discord server</a> to tell us about your challenges.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Operating on just the gut feeling about who FreeCAD users are is not nearly sufficient to make good decisions. Let's do a user survey instead.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FreeCAD puts swiss army knives to shame with its plethora of tools and workflows shipped by default: mechanical design and FEA tools, architecture and BIM tools, 2D drafting tools, CAM tools etc. It’s a very impressive achievement for a project that is operated entirely by volunteers in their spare time. But it’s also a bit of a curse.</p><p>One of the things that users consistently tell us is that FreeCAD can be overwhelming. When we look at proprietary alternatives, they mostly don’t try to do everything. AutoCAD, Inventor/F360, and Revit are all separate products aimed at different users and use cases. And even though F360 comes with a set of machining tools, there are also other advanced CAM options available for the program as well.</p><p>So we think there’s a potential for learning something here, and for that we’d like to get a larger sampling of opinions.</p><p>Some of what we would like to learn about FreeCAD users:</p><ul><li>Who you are, what you do, and what you need from your CAD software.</li><li>Whether you use both mechanical design and architecture workflows at the same time.</li><li>What you start with when you work on a project and what you produce as output.</li><li>How you manage your files is important and we want to learn how you do it today and how you’d like to do it tomorrow.</li><li>Which features and capabilities are essential to your work.</li><li>And ultimately, whether you prefer a more tailored user experience or a single, more powerful tool that might be harder to learn.</li></ul><p>We've prepared a quick survey  which takes less than five minutes to complete. Of course, we’ll share any interesting insights with the community.</p><a href="https://forms.gle/DWyeSongxJCGmfQ26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/takesurvey.png" class="img_ev3q"></a>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>“I like to have options. I don’t like the idea of entire industries being
beholden unto the whims of big software developers.” — <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PLC/comments/tjbcxr/comment/i1j9ktg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taste_of_Based on
r/PLC</a></p></blockquote><p>When we talk to customers, the question of import/export comes up repeatedly. Working with DWG files is necessary for collaborating with upstream or downstream partner organizations, but these proprietary formats make things extremely difficult if anyone in the chain is not using an official Autodesk tool.</p><blockquote><p>“... Autodesk takes great care to make sure no other CAD tool is 100%
compatible. If you edit a .dwg file with an external editor there is a good
chance you will damage the file and AutoCAD won’t be able to read it again.
This has been a MAJOR headache for decades but unfortunately Autodesk has
vendor-locked entire industries.” — <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cad/comments/wdkm61/comment/iiiz85c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mud_tug on r/CAD</a></p></blockquote><p>There’s no getting around the fact that Autodesk’s tools and formats are effectively industry standards. We’ve already discussed on this blog how <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/hard-lessons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autodesk entrenchment begins with students learning AutoCAD at education institutions</a>, only to discover later that they’ve painted themselves into a corner when it’s too expensive and hard to switch away from. That pipeline leads to entrenchment in industry where the dependence on Autodesk self-perpetuates:</p><blockquote><p>“We use it because we think everyone else is using it, so it is easier to sub
when you are on the same software. Everyone else uses it because they all
think we use it. It’s this endless feedback loop and why Autodesk has such a
tight grip on the construction industry.” — <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Revit/comments/t8qod9/comment/hzpjvv4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">To_Fight_The_Night on r/Revit</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-is-the-de-facto-industry-standard-not-an-open-standard">Why is the de facto ‘industry standard’ not an open standard?<a href="#why-is-the-de-facto-industry-standard-not-an-open-standard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why is the de facto ‘industry standard’ not an open standard?" title="Direct link to Why is the de facto ‘industry standard’ not an open standard?">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dwg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DWG</a> has been in use for 50 years and is widely used to exchange files. While the <code>.dwg</code> file format itself is not a trademark (despite Autodesk’s <a href="https://www.mccarthy.ca/en/insights/articles/court-refuses-extend-trade-mark-protection-file-extensions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attempts to prevent others from using it</a>) it is proprietary. Other programs have reverse engineered solutions to work with the format, but Autodesk actively discourages interoperability between its own DWG files and those created or modified by other programs:</p><blockquote><p>“Autodesk didn’t like the fact that people could use DWG files without paying them, so they made the format progressively more difficult to save and load. Looking at the current format shows they made several attempts at making it difficult, as other programs adapted … In the latest versions of AutoCAD, they've added a key to the format which only they are allowed to use. If another program saves a DWG that loads perfectly well, but does not have that key, AutoCAD will pop up a stern warning about this being an unsupported DWG format that might cause terrible problems. Although it obviously won't.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In short, they use their dominance of the marketplace to act like money
grabbing assholes.” — <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cad/comments/smoi5c/comment/hvxxpdp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quaderrordemonstand on r/CAD</a></p></blockquote><p>The challenge with industry standards being closed is that despite Autodesk’s best efforts to maintain a monopoly, not everyone you need to collaborate with has access to the same tooling and same versions. Loss of data and integrity becomes a risk when exchanging files outside of Autodesk’s ecosystem.</p><p>Back in 2020, a number of leading design firms called for better interoperability in an <a href="http://extranetevolution.com/2020/07/design-firms-demand-change-at-autodesk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open letter to Autodesk’s CEO</a>. More than three years later, there doesn’t seem to have been any improvements. Why isn’t there more of an outcry from users?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="autodesk-claims-to-care-about-interoperability">Autodesk claims to care about interoperability<a href="#autodesk-claims-to-care-about-interoperability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Autodesk claims to care about interoperability" title="Direct link to Autodesk claims to care about interoperability">​</a></h2><p>Despite actively impeding interoperability of its proprietary file formats, Autodesk pays lip service to the benefits of interoperability (when it suits them).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="own-your-data-as-long-as-its-within-our-suite">Own your data, as long as it’s within our suite<a href="#own-your-data-as-long-as-its-within-our-suite" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Own your data, as long as it’s within our suite" title="Direct link to Own your data, as long as it’s within our suite">​</a></h3><p>In a paper titled <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/industry/manufacturing/cad-interoperability" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Own Your Data: What Data Portability Means for the Construction Industry”</a>, Autodesk describes the common pain points of disparate teams trying to collaborate with each other and with contractors.</p><blockquote><p>“Each member of a construction team will typically store data in a different location or within a tool available only to their own group. Other team members don’t have access to each other’s data, which makes collecting all the important information in one central location a difficult task. The silo effect is also a roadblock to data and information transparency. A system without transparency is not functional in a modern, tech-enabled construction environment.”</p></blockquote><p>They make a great argument for the value of data portability. The natural conclusion of this argument would be for portability across programs using the same format, but Autodesk uses it to promote its own product, <a href="https://construction.autodesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autodesk Construction Cloud</a>.</p><p>You don’t need everyone to use the same software, but you do need interoperability between software file formats. How does “Own your data” ring true when that data is encoded in a proprietary format?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-standards-when-it-suits-us">Open standards, when it suits us<a href="#open-standards-when-it-suits-us" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open standards, when it suits us" title="Direct link to Open standards, when it suits us">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>Autodesk is also happy to toot its own horn about interoperability when it comes to their products’ capabilities to <a href="https://damassets.autodesk.net/content/dam/autodesk/www/industry/bim/interoperability-/assets/q2-adsk-atheletes%20vill%20EGA%20customer-story_V0.7_en-us.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read and modify multiple file formats</a>.</p></blockquote><p>This sentiment does not appear to extend to Autodesk letting its proprietary file formats play nice with other programs. It also feels disingenuous after they attempted to remove support for exporting STEP files from Fusion360 for personal use licensees (then backpedaled after backlash from the community).</p><p>There are many other examples of Autodesk paying lip service to open standards and interoperability, but it’s hard to swallow without any real justification for the company’s continued commitment to keeping DWG closed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-real-reasons-for-closed-formats">The real reasons for closed formats<a href="#the-real-reasons-for-closed-formats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The real reasons for closed formats" title="Direct link to The real reasons for closed formats">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>“… having been through those wars of ‘standard/interoperable file format’ on both the CAD producer and consumer side... (I was even on the IGES committee for a short while in the 1980s.)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Companies would love to have it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>CAD companies, on the other hand, not so much. Their goal is to sell more

The ability to interpret parametric data and recalculate a model requires the entire geometry kernel and CAD application. This kind of lock-in is unavoidable. When it comes to interoperability though, we don’t expect to transfer the HOW part of the system. We only expect to transfer the WHAT (the geometry of the model). Autodesk however is locking customers in by not allowing them to transfer the geometry at all.</p><p>If users were able to choose their tools purely based on performance and new features instead of trying to avoid the headache of data transfer, Autodesk’s empire would be threatened.</p><p>As an open-core company building around open-source software, openness and interoperability is central to our mission.  We want to give our users the best possible experience. We want them to trust the software and have confidence that we won't use it to lock them in. We want to give them the choice to use our software exclusively or in conjunction with other tools if that's what their workflow requires.  If your CAD vendor can't say the same thing, maybe you should find one who can.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Look, there are good reasons why the price of a software product could go up: rising R&amp;D and maintenance costs, market saturation, rising inflation rate etc. But Autodesk’s latest announcement of bumping the Fusion 360 price yet again makes people—especially small businesses—cringe, and it’s easy to see why. It’s about what you do and how you communicate that to users:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Fusion 360 price change announcement" src="/assets/images/fusion360-price-increase-844d84b0b616ddf018942bc9b6d9623d.jpg" width="818" height="465" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Source: <a href="https://lemmy.world/post/9022106" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lemmy.World</a></p><p>Isn’t it just a fancy way of saying “We know you love Fusion, so we think we’ll get away with making you pay more for it”?</p><p>This isn’t the first time. In 2020, they ripped useful features out of the free tier and moved it to the paid tier while promising to “continue to make Fusion 360 the most affordable end-to-end product development tool in the market”. Or, as one user at Lemmy.World said:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://lemmy.world/comment/5739138" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">They pulled the rug out from underneath users years ago with F360.</a></p></blockquote><p>This was later followed by a price tag bump from $495 to $545. And now come January 1, 2024, Fusion users will start paying $690, a 130% increase over 10 years.</p><p>Removing features from the free tier and continuously raising the price of the paid tier — it’s a hard pill to swallow. People have a deeply rooted desire to be in control of their life in general, and their software and data in particular. And this is where free and open-source software has the upper hand. Hence the influx of Fusion refugees that the FreeCAD community has been seeing since September 2020.</p><p>We think the industry is tired of playing by Autodesk’s rules. There are dozens of big and small software vendors that are chipping away at its market domination. Ondsel is happily contributing to the effort of making CAD software actually affordable for students, hobbyists, and professionals alike. We are pretty open, if not vocal about the work we do, and now you can <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/assembly-wb-prerelease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test the latest and greatest by downloading our ‘playground’ build of FreeCAD</a>.  When you get tired of Autodesk’s ‘rebalancing’, why not see what life is like for our users?  </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Stemfie Rebalancing" src="/assets/images/stemfie-rebalancing-0e66dbd8d558e5bcba7b1550b306bb92.png" width="1022" height="690" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have just published our own build of FreeCAD with built-in Ondsel Solver and the new integrated assembly workbench. Now everyone can take an early look at the assembly workflow coming in FreeCAD v1.0. </p><p><a href="https://github.com/Ondsel-Development/FreeCAD/releases/tag/Assembly_Playground" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download the Playground</a></p><p><a href="https://lens.ondsel.com/share/656a121fd934f1f1e66ffd8d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download a completed assembly to test</a></p><p>In this post, we’ll guide you through the workflow and set some expectations.</p><p>For starters, we’ve prepared a short video that demonstrates the workflow. </p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:1rem"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MI2JMm__bkM" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0"></iframe></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quick-faq">Quick FAQ<a href="#quick-faq" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Quick FAQ" title="Direct link to Quick FAQ">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-it">What is it?<a href="#what-is-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is it?" title="Direct link to What is it?">​</a></h3><p>This is the Ondsel build of FreeCAD with the new Ondsel Solver and the WIP assembly workbench enabled.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-can-i-do-with-it">What can I do with it?<a href="#what-can-i-do-with-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What can I do with it?" title="Direct link to What can I do with it?">​</a></h3><p>You can create assemblies, either by linking existing parts from other files or by creating new parts using Part Designer.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-to-expect">What to expect?<a href="#what-to-expect" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What to expect?" title="Direct link to What to expect?">​</a></h3><p>Bugs! Seriously, this is very ‘fresh’ code. Bugs are a certainty.</p><p>Confusion. Documentation hasn’t been written yet, and it’s likely too early for that. Some things that look like bugs might be correct behavior and vice versa.</p><p>Missing functionality. Some basic things work, some basic things don’t, and all advanced features simply haven’t been developed yet. Exciting times!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="concepts">Concepts<a href="#concepts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Concepts" title="Direct link to Concepts">​</a></h2><p>Assembly introduces some new concepts and re-uses some concepts from other parts of FreeCAD. Let’s learn them in a tutorial fashion.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="assembly-container">Assembly container<a href="#assembly-container" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Assembly container" title="Direct link to Assembly container">​</a></h3><p>The assembly is a top-level object. It contains:</p><ul><li>the parts that are assembled together,</li><li>the joints (see below) that establish relationships between parts,</li><li>a local coordinate system.</li></ul><p>Let’s switch to the Assembly workbench and create a new assembly:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Create a new assembly" src="/assets/images/createassembly-da8b5d550b1c941537bc5759ef3830d6.gif" width="798" height="755" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For now, you can have multiple assemblies in a document but, at most, only one can be active at a time. Activating assemblies is just like activating bodies — double-click or right-click and choose ‘Toggle Active Part’ at the top of the menu:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Toggle active part" src="/assets/images/ToggleActive-0d49acea619f8cd333d9f471b8968c0c.gif" width="761" height="975" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="adding-parts-to-an-assembly">Adding parts to an assembly<a href="#adding-parts-to-an-assembly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Adding parts to an assembly" title="Direct link to Adding parts to an assembly">​</a></h3><p>Before you can assemble a set of parts, you have to add them to the assembly. Select them in the tree and drag them onto the Assembly node:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Drag parts into assembly" src="/assets/images/addparts-69c913f3cf6bbadff6cdd4857dd4583e.gif" width="766" height="771" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dragging-parts-around">Dragging parts around<a href="#dragging-parts-around" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Dragging parts around" title="Direct link to Dragging parts around">​</a></h3><p>The workbench introduces a new interaction in the GUI window. It is meant to simplify repositioning parts within an assembly. Rather than using the transform tool or other positioning tool, you can just single click them in the 3D window and drag them:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Reposition parts" src="/assets/images/dragging-1f289d34655fd4056667ec43d0bd31ff.gif" width="1029" height="1092" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>A few things to remember:</p><ul><li>Dragging only works inside an <strong>active</strong> assembly.  </li><li>You can’t drag parts that aren’t part of the assembly</li><li>The more joints you add to a part, the less degrees of freedom it has</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="joints">Joints<a href="#joints" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Joints" title="Direct link to Joints">​</a></h3><p>The heart of the Assembly WB are the joints. These define how parts are connected together.  Right now, the workbench offers only a small subset of joint types that will become available over time.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Available joint types" src="/assets/images/joints-7757849030ce9be434653ae8c88d1262.png" width="455" height="69" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="grounding-a-part-groundedjoint">Grounding a Part (GroundedJoint)<a href="#grounding-a-part-groundedjoint" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Grounding a Part (GroundedJoint)" title="Direct link to Grounding a Part (GroundedJoint)">​</a></h3><p>A grounded part or body is one that cannot translate or rotate; in other words, it has zero degrees of freedom. The solver will not execute if there isn’t at least a single grounded part in the assembly. Select a part and toggle the GroundedJoint by clicking the respective button in the toolbar.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Ground a part" src="/assets/images/GroundPart-76d16f3b0701627220a7781899109588.gif" width="766" height="771" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="adding-a-joint">Adding a Joint<a href="#adding-a-joint" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Adding a Joint" title="Direct link to Adding a Joint">​</a></h3><p>Select the type of joint you want to create from the toolbar. This will open a task panel. Then select geometry from the parts. Apply the joint by clicking OK.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Add a joint" src="/assets/images/createjoint-d0e84fe24f0b0519585886543e63a04e.gif" width="761" height="975" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="joint-coordinate-system-jcs">Joint Coordinate System (JCS)<a href="#joint-coordinate-system-jcs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Joint Coordinate System (JCS)" title="Direct link to Joint Coordinate System (JCS)">​</a></h3><p>When a joint is being added, you’ll see the Joint Coordinate System overlaying the part. You can toggle the visibility of these off by selecting the joint in the tree and pressing the spacebar.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Placing a joint coordinate system" src="/assets/images/addjointLCS-585d14c6d06ef082ed99084bf2f77646.gif" width="636" height="398" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>When you’re selecting the geometry for a joint, pay attention to where the joint indicators land. This depends on the mouse position.

        <updated>2023-11-15T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This new initiative by FreeCAD contributors will hopefully bring much desired systemic UX/UI improvements to the program.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Free and Open-Source Software has a reputation for poor usability and user experience (UX). FreeCAD is no exception. Some of the most common complaints raised by users are about the steep learning curve, inconsistent workflow, and ugly, confusing user-interface (UI). There are dozens of threads on the forum going back years where someone has come forward with a vision to ‘fix’ the usability problem. These efforts always devolve into bike-shedding, and nitpicking. Nothing changes.</p><p>Why does this keep happening?  After all, UI/UX is an established discipline. There are books and published research about it.  There are <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consultants</a> and ‘best practices’.  Why is it so hard to make progress?</p><p>The answer is that like other parts of the umbrella discipline called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘human factors’</a>, UI/UX is all about humans and humans are messy.   Unlike source code that either works or doesn’t, there are many ways to skin the usability cat.  Most of us use software all the time with no appreciation or understanding of why it’s good or bad. We know good design when we see it but most of us can’t say why it’s good.  When we use software that we like, we attribute our positive perception to whichever UI elements we notice.  We overlook the thousands of other elements that don’t catch our attention because they just work right.</p><p><em>Mary likes the way DoodlyCAD uses ribbon bars.  FreeCAD doesn’t have ribbon bars and that’s why she hates FreeCAD.  She didn’t notice that DoodlyCAD has consistent task panels, great use of screen real estate, and excellent discoverability of features.</em></p><p>“Ok, smart guy”, I hear you say.  “Is the situation hopeless?  Can we possibly make progress in this area?”.  Yes, dear reader, I think we can.  In fact, I think we are!  A small but industrious team led by Obelisk on the FreeCAD Discord server has started an initiative that aims to avoid the pitfalls of the past and move us in a direction that is data- and research-driven, productive, and sustainable. </p><p>The approach they are taking starts with first principles of UI/UX design.  If you spend time reading the channel, you’ll hear terms like <a href="https://lawsofux.com/fittss-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fitts law</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/weavedesign/the-doherty-threshold-and-designing-for-human-computer-interaction-f0a47c8ab583" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doherty threshold</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hick-Hyman</a>, and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Usability-Heuristics</a>. Rather than focusing on individual features, they are establishing an overarching conception of how the user experience should be organized.  This isn’t a bold new vision with grand unattainable goals.  It first seeks to understand and document how the FreeCAD experience works when it works well. That documentation is the <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/designguide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Guide</a>.</p><p>As the design guide matures, we can use the guidelines to review the user experience when it doesn’t work well and improve it without introducing new inconsistencies.</p><p>The project has larger goals.  They’re spending considerable time talking about zones of the UI, task flow, and what the default configuration should be.  They’re also thinking about how UI templates can be created that make it easier for developers to implement new functionality without needing to reinvent the wheel every time.   Effort has been spent on recommendations for color use, code structure, and other details that will help addon developers make their contributions feel like a native part of FreeCAD.</p><blockquote><p>"After more than 20 years of development by a global community of volunteers, an incredibly complex and advanced set of features is available in FreeCAD. My hope is to leverage all of the incredible time and effort invested by that community to present a coherent vision for both beginner and advanced users that is based on strong principles. With the highly anticipated 1.0 release on the horizon an opportunity to help provide a positive 'out-of-the-box' experience and improve general productivity is extremely exciting." -Joe Sardos (Obelisk)</p></blockquote><p>Yet, it’s the short-term objectives that are likely to make the biggest difference soon.  Identifying the easy fixes where user pain can be alleviated fast doesn’t just fix the problems, it gives new developers an easy on-ramp to start contributing code that will get merged.  Documenting the glossary helps with documentation, translation, and the design of future features. Clear guidelines on UI elements makes it easier to develop features and it also speeds up the review and approval process which takes load off of the maintainers.  It also makes documentation easier to write and faster to translate.</p><p>If our enthusiasm for this project isn’t clear, let me give you a few more reasons why we’re so excited this is happening and so honored to participate.   First, the data-driven and research based approach helps eliminate the toxic in-fighting on the forum.  That’s something we can all get behind.  The effort is community-led but not developer driven.  In our opinion, it’s wonderful to see other kinds of experts getting involved in open-source work.  We would love to see FOSS being a place for UI/UX experts to build experience and ultimately a career.  And finally, it provides another opportunity for the FPA to financially advance the project. The FPA is now <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fpadf-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offering grants</a> to train UI/UX contributors who commit to work on this for an extended period. </p><p>Unlike other development efforts like the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-needs-a-better-materials-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Material system overhaul</a> or the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly Workbench</a>,  improving the UI is a long-term commitment.  It’s many, <em>many</em> small improvements over time and not a single major push from a few people.  It will take time but it will work.  We’re on our way to a great user experience.  Forward!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The basics of an integrated assembly workbench in FreeCAD are now functional and will be ready for wider testing once <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another pull request</a> is merged. This means you can play with it now in the development version of FreeCAD and when version 1.0 is out, you will be able to create or link parts, create joints between them, and solve the assembly — in just a few clicks, out of the box, without installing any add-ons.</p><p>This quick video by Pierre-Louis Boyer demonstrates all that:</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:1rem"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mFsieFzOPls" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0"></iframe></div><p>This is by no means the complete implementation that we have in mind for FreeCAD, but it’s a solid foundation. And because we like to be open about our process, let’s talk about how we got to this point, how we made design decisions, what’s already available, and what else is in the pipeline.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-research">The research<a href="#the-research" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The research" title="Direct link to The research">​</a></h2><p>Users have been asking for an integrated assembly workbench for a very long time. And because writing add-ons has always been the preferable way to implement major new features in FreeCAD, people did just that: multiple 3rd-party options, each with its own workflow, incompatible with one another.</p><p>Doing extensive research of multiple assembly workbenches is really a lot to ask. And thus, users got more than what they bargained for: a solution wrapped up in confusion. Whenever a new user arrived and asked for recommendations, a very common response would be along the lines of “I don’t really know about those other workbenches, I only bothered to learn this one”.</p><p>This gave us three basic options:</p><ol><li>Pick one existing workbench, improve it, make it the default</li><li>Create a new workbench based on one or more of the existing alternatives</li><li>Create a new workbench entirely from scratch</li></ol><p>We started with a deep dive into four popular workbenches — Assembly 2, A2plus, Assembly3, and Assembly4 — and then looked at a few assembly-like add-ons. If you missed that series, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this final post</a> has all the links and discusses our plan forward at the time.</p><p>The most important takeaway from the research was that every available option had some kind of workflow and/or UX/UI problem deeply rooted into its design. So we came up with the following recommendations:</p><ol><li>Agree on the data structure with stakeholders to help making all assembly workbenches mutually compatible</li><li>Create or reuse an existing performant 3D solver</li><li>Build a clean new solution that could be iterated upon later to add advanced features</li><li>Ship a working basic implementation as part of the next big release after v0.21</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="assembly-data-structure">Assembly data structure<a href="#assembly-data-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Assembly data structure" title="Direct link to Assembly data structure">​</a></h2><p>After the research, we proceeded with standardization of the data structure. So far, only Zolko (Assembly4) has been up to discussing this. Both A2plus and Assembly3 developers haven’t yet responded to an invitation to talk about it. With luck we’ll get all major stakeholders to agree on something and/or provide conversion scripts for existing assembly projects.</p><p>We ended up designing the assembly as a Part container, just like in Assembly 4. However, multiple assemblies can be created in one document. We are not married to this design decision though and will happily reconsider if users speak up.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Assembly project structure" src="/assets/images/assembly-project-structure-70e5f23666038a702e1a778db385c1b2.webp" width="1795" height="841" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workflow-considerations">Workflow considerations<a href="#workflow-considerations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Workflow considerations" title="Direct link to Workflow considerations">​</a></h2><p>Before designing the new workbench, we looked at existing implementations in various proprietary CAD programs. We were mostly interested in how the workflow is organized and what program demands the least amount of clicks and learning from users.</p><p>There are two major approaches to constraining parts in 3D: either you select geometric features and mate them directly, or you create a local coordinate system (LCS) per each feature involved and then align those LCSs. Our implementation is a bit of both: the user does choose a pair of geometric features to connect, but FreeCAD also creates (and displays) a local joint coordinate system (JCS) for each feature.</p><p>We also found that, regardless of the workflow approach, developers of other programs indeed try to reduce the amount of clicks to an absolute minimum and make it easy to move parts under constraints.</p><p>Since we decided in favor of LCS (kinda), we’d be better off looking at something like T-FLEX CAD rather than Assembly4 for workflow tips. And in most proprietary CAD programs, moving a part means you just grab it and then drag it, whereas in Assembly3 you have three movement options in the toolbar (and it’s the least of your problems there).</p><p>The most approachable assembly workflow that we discovered was the Onshape’s one, hence much of our interaction design is loosely based on it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-what-can-the-integrated-assembly-workbench-do">So what can the integrated assembly workbench do?<a href="#so-what-can-the-integrated-assembly-workbench-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So what can the integrated assembly workbench do?" title="Direct link to So what can the integrated assembly workbench do?">​</a></h2><p>Our intention with this project is to create a solution that Just Works™ nine times out of ten. For the things it can’t do, the addon workbenches are still available and still good choices. The current state of the integrated workbench is a lean, minimally functional solution. It is, however, a solid foundation for building future functionality.</p><p>First off, it will support both top-down and bottom-up design approaches. Right now, you can create the assembly project, then proceed linking parts from existing FreeCAD projects. Or you can switch to Part Design and start building your parts, then go back to Assembly to constrain those parts.</p><p>Once you have all the parts you need in the project, choose a joint type in the toolbar.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Joints toolbar" src="/assets/images/assembly-joints-toolbar-752ccc03f94e23b76939d9a729ec8862.webp" width="1263" height="485" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So far, available joint types are:</p><ul><li>Fixed joint: zero degrees of freedom, parts are permanently locked together</li><li>Revolute joint: allow rotation around a single axis between selected parts</li><li>Cylindrical joint: allow rotation along one axis and movement along the same axis between two parts</li><li>Slider joint: allow movement along one axis between two parts</li><li>Ball joint: allow unrestricted movement of two parts as long as their connection points remain in contact</li><li>Planar joint: two selected features must be in the same plane, movement is restricted to that plane</li><li>Parallel joint: constrain relative movement of selected features to parallel translations</li><li>Tangent joint: forces two geometric features to be tangent, restrict movement to smooth transitions along their contact surface.</li></ul><p>When you select a joint type and hover a geometric feature of a part, FreeCAD displays a joint coordinate system for that feature:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Assembly JCS preview" src="/assets/images/assembly-jcs-preview-5b3335cd84c0a4c24a2a887a2a35f054.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So all you need to do is click on the hovered feature to add it to the selection (displayed in a floating dialog on the right), then pick a geometric feature of the second part and click OK.</p><p>Once all parts are connected with joints, you can move them under constraints. You don’t need an extra tool for that. Just grab a part and drag it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-organization">Project organization<a href="#project-organization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project organization" title="Direct link to Project organization">​</a></h2><p>We were really pleased with the way the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TNP project</a> operated, so we decided to model the assembly workbench project after it: public project board on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">done</a>), a mix of Ondsel employees and FreeCAD contributors (done), and atomic pull requests into the main development branch (done).</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Kanban board for the assembly project on GitHub" src="/assets/images/assembly-github-board-8783d55360618acc197a018e1ba3641f.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Our lead developer for the assembly workbench project is Pierre-Louis Boyer (‘Paddle’ on the FreeCAD forum) who already has a lot of experience improving UX/UI in FreeCAD.</p><p>Something we were missing was expertise in 3D solvers. We hired Dr. Aik-Siong Koh who has decades of experience in programming kinematic and multi-body dynamics solvers. He also has an existing solver originally written in Smalltalk. Dr. Koh ported his solver to C++ and made it <a href="https://github.com/Ondsel-Development/OndselSolver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available</a> under the terms of LGPL 2.1+.</p><p>Another Ondsel employee (and co-founder) John Dupuy contributed to turning Ondsel Solver into a shared library and fixing build issues on supported platforms.</p><p>Outside of Ondsel, FreeCAD maintainers Werner Mayer and Chris Hennes have been doing code review of all the pull requests we submitted.</p><p>We were also fortunate to receive contributions from the design review team early on: Qewer <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/10662#issuecomment-1716991225" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributed icons</a> for joints and <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improved</a> the appearance of JCS previews. Additionally, Tobias Falk and howie-j have been participating in the UX/UI discussions and providing <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11158" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patches</a>.</p><p>Based on our experience with the TNP and the assembly projects so far we are confident suggesting that this collaboration model should be used more in FreeCAD. Hopefully, more companies will adopt it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next" title="Direct link to What’s next">​</a></h2><p>Our attention right now is focused on <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">completing</a> the use of Ondsel Solver and cleaning up the rest. If the intention to release FreeCAD 1.0 around FOSDEM 2024 is still strong among maintainers, that gives us close to three months of leeway.</p><p>Implementing major new features in the workbench in time for v1.0 seems unlikely to happen, although minor enhancements like easily inserting fasteners is a possibility. So we will mostly be finishing what we have already started to deliver a lean, minimalistic, well-tested integrated assembly workbench in the v1.0 release.</p><p>After that the floor will be open to all sorts of things: BOM generation, collision detection, assembly explosion, animation etc. We are particularly excited about the possibilities that the new materials system by Dave Carter will bring to us. If you ever needed to calculate the weight of an entire assembly or locate its center of mass, you definitely know why.</p><p>We invite everyone to help us test and improve the new workbench. There is a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public kanban board</a> on GitHub where assembly-specific tasks are managed. Right now, we need testers even more than we need programmers. So come talk to us. Report a bug or  pick a card you would like to work on and comment on the related issue to get things going.</p><p>And finally, we believe this workbench will become an important part of the FreeCAD design kit.  We are confident that many great things can be built on top of this foundation and we’re not wasting time. We have already started an internal project to expand the feature set beyond what you would expect from an assembly workbench with a kinematic solver. Stay tuned for updates!</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2023-10-30T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are intorducing on-viewport tool widgets to create fully constrained sketches,as well as tool settings to set various properties and drafting behavior.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’ve already introduced some improvements to sketching with constraints before, when Pierre-Louis Boyer implemented <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/ondsel-made-constraining-sketches-faster-and-easier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contextual constraints</a>. But there are more usability gaps there, and we are targeting them one by one. There’s another major change currently undergoing code review: on-viewport tool widgets to create fully constrained sketches and tool settings to set various properties and choose drafting behavior.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="drafting-fully-constrained-sketches">Drafting fully constrained sketches<a href="#drafting-fully-constrained-sketches" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Drafting fully constrained sketches" title="Direct link to Drafting fully constrained sketches">​</a></h2><p>Thanks to Ondsel’s developer Pierre-Louis Boyer and FreeCAD maintainer Abdullah Tahiriyo, the Sketcher workbench is now getting UX/UI improvements that aim to improve drafting fully constrained sketches. Pierre-Louis shot a quick video for internal use that we are sharing with you.</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:1rem"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z-rA2zX5mas" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0"></iframe></div><p>Here is a quick explainer of what’s coming in version 1.0 here.</p><p>The usual workflow for creating a sketch is drawing shapes, then constraining them. That takes quite a while, if you intend to fully constrain a shape. Let’s say we draw just a line. To fully constrain it, we then have to:</p><ul><li>Select its start and constrain its distance to X and Y coordinate origins (for XY plane)</li><li>Select the line and constrain its distance</li><li>Add another constrain to define its angle to X (for XY plane)</li></ul><p>Of course, there are several more ways to fully constrain a line, but the general idea is the same: draw a line in roughly the right spot, then “fix” it.</p><p>If we are drawing more complex shapes (e.g. polygons), getting them fully constrained takes even more time and effort, though contextual constraints help with that somewhat. Can we speed it up? Yes, that’s the point of this coming improvement.</p><p>Now when you select a shape-drawing tool and hover the viewport, FreeCAD will display numeric entry widgets right in the viewport. When you type in a new value and press the <strong>Tab</strong> key, FreeCAD applies a constraint, updates the shape in the viewport, and moves the focus to the next entry widget. This is how it works for a line:</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/sketcher-fully-constrained-line.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>Currently supported objects are points, lines, rectangles, circles, and polygons. It’s possible to add support for more object types.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tool-settings">Tool settings<a href="#tool-settings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tool settings" title="Direct link to Tool settings">​</a></h2><p>The second user-visible part of the patch is introducing tool settings in the Tasks panel. This helps build more expressive tools.</p><p><strong>Different ways to define a shape</strong> will now be easily accessible: e.g. a line can be defined by the position of two points or by a combination of the start point’s coordinates, the length of the line, and the angle.</p><p>Another possibility is <strong>different shape styles</strong>. A rectangle with rounded corners can now be an option of the regular rectangle tool. Similarly, rectangles can have a frame around them with user-defined thickness.</p><p>Finally, you can use it to <strong>set an inherent property of a shape</strong>, such as the amount of sides in a polygon.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/sketcher-tool-options-short.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>The same can be applied to arcs and conics later on.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="further-work">Further work<a href="#further-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Further work" title="Direct link to Further work">​</a></h2><p>This is still an early implementation undergoing review, so there will be both minor tweaks and new features further down the road. Here are some of the ideas we have:</p><ul><li>Enabling expressions in the spinboxes</li><li>Adding Rotate, Scale, Translate tools with on-viewport widgets</li><li>Adding a Chamfer tool to Sketcher</li></ul><p>Another thing we are planning to do is make full constraining an optional feature for users who want to be able to decide how many degrees of freedom they need for each particular shape. This could be a global preference setting or a quick toggle in the toolbar when you need to mix both approaches in the same project.</p><p>We are looking forward to reading your feedback. Until the patch has been merged, the best place to provide it is the <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull request</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Proprietary educational licenses set students up to learn some hard lessons about vendor lock-in once they go out on their own.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s common for vendors to make free licenses available to educational institutions, and while this can be helpful for enabling students to learn the tools of the trade, it can also set them up to learn some hard lessons about vendor lock-in once they go out on their own.</p><p>To add context to this piece we’ve included insights from <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/lukas-du-plessis-21424240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Lukas du Plessis</a>, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Pretoria (specializing in Machine Design and Manufacturing). Dr du Plessis introduced FreeCAD to his second-year curriculum back in 2020.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-is-proprietary-cad-software-the-default-at-universities">Why is proprietary CAD software the default at universities?<a href="#why-is-proprietary-cad-software-the-default-at-universities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why is proprietary CAD software the default at universities?" title="Direct link to Why is proprietary CAD software the default at universities?">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>“Corporations offer ‘student’ and ‘community’ licenses because they hope that these will lead to users getting jobs where they will ask their employers to purchase these tools. They do not do this because they want to nurture the hobbyists or craftspeople.” – <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/09/16/autodesk-announces-major-changes-to-fusion0-personal-use-license-terms/#comment-6279614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrightBlueJim on Hackaday.com</a></p></blockquote><p>It’s not an act of charity or goodwill for vendors to make their software free to use for educational purposes: the entrenchment of tools like SOLIDWORKS and Fusion 360 at these institutions is a key part of their pipeline as students graduate, enter the workforce, and advocate to use familiar tools at work.</p><p>These tools then become entrenched in workplaces, making it difficult for graduates to onboard if they don’t know how to use the software already:</p><blockquote><p>“Not choosing Autodesk is a career ending mistake in many cases, too.” –  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24505752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emteycz on Hacker News</a></p></blockquote><p>This is fine for students joining a big firm with plenty of budget for their seat. But good luck to graduates who want to start their own businesses and suddenly can’t afford the license.</p><p>This pattern is hard to shift, as educators can (understandably) be resistant to the burden of learning and then teaching a new tool. It’s tricky to coordinate across a department and align on what software is being used and taught in different years and modules. Even where educators are willing to bring in free alternatives (like FreeCAD), their lack of polish can be off putting to students.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="your-students-deserve-better">Your students deserve better<a href="#your-students-deserve-better" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Your students deserve better" title="Direct link to Your students deserve better">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>“F360 is probably the easiest to learn, but... I strongly recommend also learning FreeCAD so you have a backup plan if you aren’t made of money.” –  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fusion360/comments/r88l8x/is_fusion360_hard_to_learn/hn6k5b3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LightStormPilot on r/Fusion360</a></p></blockquote><p>As educators, your students are your customers. Your responsibility is to set them up for success by teaching them design principles, not one specific tool. Including exposure to open source solutions in curricula gives students a number of benefits:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="flexibility">Flexibility<a href="#flexibility" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Flexibility" title="Direct link to Flexibility">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>“It’s like a teacher teaching students to write a letter. The emphasis should be on the communication and writing skills—not on the tool. The teacher can’t teach the students to use Microsoft Word in order for them to write the letter.” – Dr Lukas du Plessis, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Pretoria</p></blockquote><p>Of course, it is important to introduce students to industry-standard, commercial software so that  they’re prepared for the workforce, but it’s a disservice not to at least expose them to the alternatives. Students who go into industry will be working in environments with mixed software, and educators should anticipate and include interoperability in the curriculum. They should be skeptical of software provided by corporations that doesn’t support data portability.</p><p>Students should at least understand that the choice of which software they use has long-term implications:</p><ul><li>Will they be able to switch to something else later if it becomes too expensive or no longer serves their needs?</li><li>Will it work on their own computer when they don’t have access to their current setup?</li></ul><p>Open source software unlocks far greater flexibility and customization for different use cases: for example, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxHr9sYNRUo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guitar workbench</a> presented at the <a href="https://www.up.ac.za/mechanical-and-aeronautical-engineering/article/3136162/freecad-users-conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD User Conference</a> earlier this year. “There’s no commercial package that will develop such a workbench, it’s far too niche,” says Dr du Plessis.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="performance">Performance<a href="#performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Performance" title="Direct link to Performance">​</a></h3><p>This aspect of the open source vs proprietary conversation doesn’t always get a lot of airtime, but it’s especially pertinent for educational institutions: commercial CAD software is often extremely hard wearing and resource intensive, and requires bleeding-edge hardware to perform at its best. Educational institutions rarely have access to the kind of hardware needed to make the software run effectively.</p><p>FreeCAD however is better suited for this environment, according to Dr du Plessis: “I introduced FreeCAD at the University of Pretoria and it’s not very hardware intensive—we’ve had no issues in the computer labs.”</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="institutions-can-be-the-change">Institutions can be the change<a href="#institutions-can-be-the-change" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Institutions can be the change" title="Direct link to Institutions can be the change">​</a></h2><p>It’s encouraging to see some educators taking initiative to change the course. Dr du Plessis, as mentioned above, has been advocating for students to get exposure to and learn FreeCAD at the University of Pretoria.</p><p>The university historically has taught SOLIDWORKS to students from their first year. As he started learning FreeCAD himself, Dr du Plessis has been introducing FreeCAD to his second-year students since 2020. “It doesn’t make sense to have access to free software, but then only afterwards the students need to start paying for exorbitant licenses.”</p><p>In 2019, Dr du Plessis received funding from the UK’s <a href="https://africaprize.raeng.org.uk/about-the-prize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royal Academy of Engineering</a> to develop a separate workbench inside FreeCAD. One of the deliverables was to introduce FreeCAD in the university’s undergraduate program, which helped give credibility to the initiative.</p><p>“I make students very much aware of the fact that commercial packages come at a premium,” says Dr du Plessis. “I also push hard for them to understand that there is a free version. Yes, it’s not as refined, but it’s good enough for 95% of what they want to do.”</p><p>Dr du Plessis also has a vision for what he calls FreeCAD Free Labs to make FreeCAD more accessible to more makers.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-educators-and-students-can-do">What educators and students can do<a href="#what-educators-and-students-can-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What educators and students can do" title="Direct link to What educators and students can do">​</a></h2><p>Yes, there is a burden to learning new technology and then teaching it to your students, but there are a lot of free resources out there that you can point students to. You can lean on educational creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FreeCADAcademy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Academy on YouTube</a> and the <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD community</a> so you can focus on teaching design principles.</p><p>To any students reading this, it’s also up to you to take responsibility for your own education. Be wary of any educator that requires a particular tool rather than teaching you the principles of use that can be generalized. You don’t need permission to explore alternative tools.</p><p>The <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Project Association</a> is interested in broadening the use of FreeCAD in education. They’ve set up a brief survey to gather feedback and start building a network of interested people. They’d love to hear from folks in academia but also non-traditional educators making YouTube content or paid courses.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="take-the-survey"><em><a href="https://forms.gle/zXZFP5yf2ZwrnPbN7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Take The Survey</a></em><a href="#take-the-survey" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to take-the-survey" title="Direct link to take-the-survey">​</a></h2>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many great addon ideas die because the implementation suffers from common and avoidable mistakes. Let's discuss how to avoid some of them.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s well over 200 various addons for FreeCAD available just in the official add-on manager. Many more possibly flew under the radar or simply never have been shared with anybody.</p><p>For some developers, creating an add-on is a way to test ideas and see if they resonate with a larger audience. For others, it’s the first step towards contributing to FreeCAD itself. The add-on ecosystem is hugely important for the community at large.</p><p>But many great ideas die because the add-on implementation suffers from one or more common and avoidable mistakes:</p><ul><li>Not designed to make contributions from other developers easy.</li><li>Built with implementations of things that are core FreeCAD features.</li><li>Not built with good software practices in mind, think modular code, unit tests, separation of UI and non-UI logic.</li></ul><p>This isn’t a criticism of the addon developers. Nobody is expert in everything for many open-source contributors, writing an Add-on is their first experience contributing to a large project.</p><p>Over the last decade, I patched other people’s add-ons and wrote some of my own. In this post, I’d like to share what I think are best practices of developing 3rd-party add-ons for FreeCAD. There’s a technical and a design aspect to this.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-advice">Technical advice<a href="#technical-advice" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technical advice" title="Direct link to Technical advice">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="design-the-ui-with-qt-creator-and-use-the-ui-files-directly">Design the UI with QT Creator and use the .ui files directly.<a href="#design-the-ui-with-qt-creator-and-use-the-ui-files-directly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Design the UI with QT Creator and use the .ui files directly." title="Direct link to Design the UI with QT Creator and use the .ui files directly.">​</a></h3><p>There are several reasons why this is a great idea. First off, this makes the code simpler. Hundreds of lines of Qt code are replaced with a single line to load the .ui file like:</p><p><code>Form = FreeCADGui.PySideUic.loadUi(dialog.ui)</code></p><p>The UI logic becomes much cleaner and more testable. Secondly, UI designers are used to working with visual tools. They can often improve the look and feel of a dialog or task panel quickly. Using the UI files directly rather than hand-coding Qt or converting the .ui file to python makes it much easier for UI designers to contribute. The wiki has <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Manual:Creating_interface_tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lots of information</a> about designing and using .ui files.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="separate-the-ui-logic-from-the-application-logic">Separate the UI logic from the application logic.<a href="#separate-the-ui-logic-from-the-application-logic" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Separate the UI logic from the application logic." title="Direct link to Separate the UI logic from the application logic.">​</a></h3><p>From the beginning, FreeCAD was designed to run without the GUI at all. It’s amazing how much you can do with FreeCAD by calling it from external scripts. So it’s really frustrating to find a great piece of addon functionality that won’t work this way.</p><p>Ideally, the UI logic is separated from the rest of the application code. Designing software this way doesn’t come naturally to amateur programmers but it isn’t too difficult and is worth learning. Even a very simple addon or workbench should have at least two Python modules, one with the logic for managing the UI, getting input from the user, and displaying it. The second module does all the interesting stuff, and it should not import FreeCADGui.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stick-with-rules-of-thumb">Stick with rules of thumb<a href="#stick-with-rules-of-thumb" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stick with rules of thumb" title="Direct link to Stick with rules of thumb">​</a></h3><p>There are some very simple rules that help keep the code clean, readable, and testable. Like all heuristics, they aren’t written in stone and there are times to ignore them. That said, take the time to understand why they exist.</p><p><strong>No function longer than 200 lines of code.</strong> There are various recommendations regarding the length of a function, but 200 LOC seems like a reasonable maximum. The general idea is that a function should do just one logical thing and could be explained in one sentence. This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/475762/revisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of red flags</a> for when a function is too long should serve you well (thanks to Ryan Delucchi).</p><p><strong>No module longer than 1K lines of code.</strong> For pretty much the same reason — readability, maintainability etc. — Python modules shouldn’t be too long. Keeping python modules short has a subtle effect on code organization. It naturally encourages better encapsulation and separation of concerns, two key concepts in software development.</p><p><strong>Write pythonic code.</strong> Unlike communities around other programming languages, the Python community, is very opinionated about code conventions. Adhering to these conventions makes Python code more readable and more efficient. Here is a <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-write-pythonic-code-208ec1513c49" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very good overview</a> by Xiaoxu Gao of what makes code in Python “pythonic”.</p><p><strong>Use Black formatting.</strong> Code formatting is sometimes a contentious issue. Part of being ‘pythonic’ is adhering to a community standard for formatting. The standard is formalized in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PEP 8</a> which asserts a number of code style conventions.  Pycodestyle will check your code against those standards (and complain when you break them). <a href="https://github.com/psf/black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black</a> automatically reformats your Python code to comply with those conventions.</p><p><strong>Write unit tests first.</strong> Nobody likes writing unit tests but everyone likes having them. Regressions are easy to introduce and difficult to catch. Unit tests invert that by making regressions harder to introduce and easier to solve. They also have a subtle effect on how you program. When you have to write unit tests, you start to write more testable code. So write unit tests early on to stay on top of it.</p><p><strong>Make UI translatable from day 1.</strong> Popular addons tend to get translated into other languages. Designing an addon with localization in mind from the beginning means you free yourself from redesigning it later on to introduce UI translation support.</p><p><strong>Make user-facing objects parametric.</strong> If the addon adds document objects to the project and expects the user to interact with them after creation, the important attributes of the object should be exposed through properties. We’ve seen good ideas implemented in such a way that if the user makes an error during the creation of an object, the only recourse is to delete the object and restart. If the creation of an object involves a task panel, double-clicking on the object in the tree should re-open the same task panel and allow the user to change settings.  FreeCAD wiki has an <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Create_a_FeaturePython_object_part_I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> that explains how to write FeaturePython objects the right way.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="be-on-the-lookout-for-things-that-belong-in-the-core">Be on the lookout for things that belong in the core<a href="#be-on-the-lookout-for-things-that-belong-in-the-core" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Be on the lookout for things that belong in the core" title="Direct link to Be on the lookout for things that belong in the core">​</a></h3><p>Occasionally features developed in a workbench really <em>should</em> exist in the core. A good example of that is the <a href="https://github.com/shaise/FreeCAD_SheetMetal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheetmetal workbench</a>. There’s an interesting bit of logic that unfolds a shape to produce a flattened version. The unfolder is computationally intense and would benefit from being implemented in C++ rather than Python. A powerful and efficient unfolder might also have utility in other workbenches. It sure takes more time and effort to communicate with other developers, get these things written correctly and merged, but it makes addons simpler, faster, and more maintainable.</p><p>On the other hand, be on the lookout for things that already <em>are</em> in the core. Inexperienced developers often reinvent the wheel and do it poorly. Experienced developers communicate a lot. So when you design an addon, talk to your peers and discuss your design. It could very well be the case that something you need or already exists and works just right for you.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="design-advice">Design advice<a href="#design-advice" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Design advice" title="Direct link to Design advice">​</a></h2><p>FreeCAD has the <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/stylebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beginnings of a style book</a>. While work on it is ongoing, here are some important considerations.</p><p><strong>Don't make the user think.</strong> In free and open-source software, the concepts of usability and discoverability are often overlooked. Do your best to design an addon with a straightforward workflow that gets users from A to Z in the least possible amount of time. Give the user a result with the minimal amount of input and let them revise and improve the result incrementally. A feature that requires the user to do many things exactly right before outputting anything at all is confusing and will be ignored by most users.</p><p><strong>Chunking.</strong> If there’s one thing you can do to make your user-interface and workflow better it is to group controls together so users can process them efficiently.</p><ul><li>Toolbars should have neither too many nor too few buttons. Seven, plus or minus two, is a guideline often invoked.</li><li>The buttons should be grouped logically. Consider that the user may hide the toolbar or drag it to another part of the screen. Menus should use separators to make them easier to process.</li><li>Dialogs should use group boxes, frames, and tabs to allow efficient recognition of controls.</li></ul><p><strong>Don’t just gravitate to workbenches.</strong> There seems to be a popular idea that a workbench is the right kind of addon for anything. And so there are some 3rd-party workbenches that should have been a non-workbench addon, an extension of an existing workbench, or even a core feature. But workbenches are destinations, if you build one, you should expect that people will park there for a while and will be unwilling to jump between workbenches all the time. So when you choose what type of an addon you are creating, think primarily of workflow and tasks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-to-do-next">What to do next<a href="#what-to-do-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What to do next" title="Direct link to What to do next">​</a></h2><p>If you are planning to write a new FreeCAD addon or improve one you have already created, I recommend paying close attention to <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Developer Guide</a>. This is where the team formalizes both programming and design conventions, as well as provides actionable advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the hallmark features of FreeCAD is increased cognitive load. Our new Dimension tool replaces mutiple other tools and helps constraining sketches faster.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the hallmark features of FreeCAD is that various parts of its UI have a lot of similar options, which means a lot of cognitive load, especially for beginners. A very popular “offender” here is the geometry constraints toolbar in Sketcher. It has 18 different constraint options, more than most popular commercial CAD offerings like Fusion 360, Onshape, and Creo. That's not a bad thing on its own, but it adds a lot of mileage when you need to dimension an entire complex sketch.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Constraint options in FreeCAD 0.21" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-0-21-ca0c28f136d7c2b19885bcdfac503e46.webp" width="1812" height="932" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Before joining Ondsel, Pierre-Louis Boyer (@paddle) started implementing a feature called <em>contextual constraints</em> to help users constrain faster. Since joining Ondsel, he has finished the <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch</a>, and after some discussion and code review it was merged to become part of future FreeCAD 1.0. This new feature is quite nice and surpasses what many commercial CAD applicaitons are able to do. So let’s take it for a drive and kick the tires!</p><p>When you select a geometric feature in a sketch, there’s a finite number of constraints you apply once you select the second feature. For example, if you select a line and then an endpoint of another line, your most meaningful option is a distance constraint. But if you select a line and then another line that’s at an angle to the first one, the angle constraint is the most meaningful option, and your other option is to make those lines equal.</p><p>Once you know that, you can devise a system that looks at the selected features, suggests the most sensible option by default, and allows switching between possible options easily. This is what the new contextual constraints system does. It helps apply constraints based on the context of what the user has already done.  You select the new Dimension option (<strong>D</strong> shortcut) and go over your entire sketch to constraint and dimension various parts of it.</p><p>The new option combines various pre-existing other ones: constraining distances, radii, diameters, angles, and a constraint lock.</p><p>Here is a quick example. Take two lines that have different length and are at a random angle and distance to each other:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Original state" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-step-0-5d05391d314dd9eaecbd7fe30f388611.webp" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Then select the Dimension option and set the length of the first line:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Length constraint" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-step-1-427a099a5d3ab3b750234d17830273bd.webp" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Set a distance between the two lines by clicking the line and then the closer endpoint of the second line:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Distance constraint" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-step-2-0ae4fd84ec5722aee371ff45753cb326.webp" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Constraint their angle by clicking the first line and the second line:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Angle constraining" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-step-3-14968feeaf87ffcfb733e6767264ecef.webp" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>And finally make both lines equal by clicking the first line and the second line and then pressing <strong>M</strong> to switch to the second contextual constraint option:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Equal length lines" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-step-4-bd02c7fc09bd19b9a686943a532a89a4.webp" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You can constrain this sketch further by clicking on an end point of one of the lines and setting a lock, all with the same Dimension option. Most importantly, all of the steps above are completed without needing to choose a different tool in the toolbar.</p><p>For cases, when you absolutely need to have quick access to individual constraint options (just like in v0.21 and earlier), you can continue using keyboard shortcuts or selecting those options in the drop-down list:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Individual options" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-individual-options-eb9ba3a20823e766d2a23393a353714f.webp" width="1547" height="836" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preserving that possibility</a> was one of the requests from users.</p><p>The new option also allows switching between complementary angles depending on the position of the mouse:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Switching between complementary angles" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-complementary-angles-ab3f4c2bfba4f9f2062f4dafad2a28f0.gif" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This implementation was possible thanks to active discussions both <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=4&amp;t=65521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the forum</a> and in the issue tracker. More improvement is still possible.  Join us if you want to be part of making FreeCAD awesome and many thanks to users and contributors for their input!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pull request rot is a quick way to turn off first-time and long-time contributors. The merge meeting is one way to get PRs moving again.</p><blockquote><p>“It isn’t just about the license, but the way that Hashicorp has maintained the Terraform project. … there are open issues and pull requests that just get ignored as Hashicorp clearly doesn’t see value in open source contributors.” – <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37135553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tedivm on Hacker News</a></p></blockquote><p>Tensions around the application of open source philosophy have been discussed a lot in recent weeks, and I want to touch on one of the objections to the recent <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37081306" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hashicorp news</a> here. We’ve talked about <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/better-github-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stale issues</a> on this blog before, and we can see in the above quote that ignored issues and PRs do have a real impact on contributor motivation and sentiment towards a project. There are a lot of reasons why some PRs slip through the cracks, but there are things you can do to catch them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-some-prs-fail-to-get-merged">Why some PRs fail to get merged<a href="#why-some-prs-fail-to-get-merged" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why some PRs fail to get merged" title="Direct link to Why some PRs fail to get merged">​</a></h2><p>PRs can suffer death by neglect or by a thousand cuts. Maintainers that ignore PRs or let them get tangled up in dozens of comments (debating the right way to address a problem or implement a feature) can expect one-time or burned-out contributors, slower releases, and a lot of wasted effort on rebasing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-pr-is-too-large-to-effectively-review">The PR is too large to effectively review<a href="#the-pr-is-too-large-to-effectively-review" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The PR is too large to effectively review" title="Direct link to The PR is too large to effectively review">​</a></h3><p>PRs that do too many things or touch too much of the codebase at once pose a risk of unforeseen side effects. They’re just too unwieldy to review thoroughly (sometimes even <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#diff-limits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub won’t render the entire diff in the PR</a>), so the reviewer doesn’t feel comfortable taking responsibility for merging.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-goals-of-the-pr-are-too-obscure">The goals of the PR are too obscure<a href="#the-goals-of-the-pr-are-too-obscure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The goals of the PR are too obscure" title="Direct link to The goals of the PR are too obscure">​</a></h3><p>Some PRs don’t explain the original problem sufficiently for someone to be able to test their behavior. That’s one end of the spectrum—at the other, not everyone contributing to a project has the same use cases, goals, or needs. Once the project evolves beyond its initial purpose and scope, you can end up with PRs that touch or implement an obscure feature that maintainers don’t understand or feel confident in reviewing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="competing-solutions-exist">Competing solutions exist<a href="#competing-solutions-exist" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Competing solutions exist" title="Direct link to Competing solutions exist">​</a></h3><p>There are usually multiple ways to solve a problem. A PR that implements one solution can devolve into a debate about the merits of that approach over others, because no consensus on direction was reached ahead of time. Sometimes there is no precedent for the reviewer to fall back on, or they lack the institutional knowledge or context to make the call.</p><p>There’s a lot of overlap with our discussion of <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-topological-naming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why RealThunder’s branch with a topological naming fix for FreeCAD hasn’t been merged yet</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="solutions">Solutions<a href="#solutions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Solutions" title="Direct link to Solutions">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bring-alignment-forward">Bring alignment forward<a href="#bring-alignment-forward" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bring alignment forward" title="Direct link to Bring alignment forward">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/better-github-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Better issues</a> → better PRs. If you can find alignment (if not consensus) at the issue stage, you avoid a lot of the agonizing over philosophy and implementation in PRs. Documenting best practices and approaches in a project charter or requiring design documents upfront can help with alignment that preempts endless debate.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="set-realistic-expectations">Set realistic expectations<a href="#set-realistic-expectations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Set realistic expectations" title="Direct link to Set realistic expectations">​</a></h3><p>Maintainers—even of small projects—need to communicate the expectations and process for successful contribution.</p><blockquote><p>“If you have no plans to maintain hobby code, you should discourage usage. Say it right up front:
‘TagTree is unsupported and not meant for use in a production Dart application, unless you're willing to fork the code and fix any bugs you find yourself.’</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Or if a project is widely used but difficult to contribute to, you should say so up front, like this:
‘Contributing code is one of the more difficult ways to contribute to Guava, and is almost never what the project really needs most <!-- -->[...]<!-- --> We know it's tempting to submit code before the feature is accepted, but this is not always a good use of your time.’” - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8713694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skybrian on Hacker News</a></p></blockquote><p>A <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributing policy</a> should, at the very least, tell contributors when to expect reviews and how to give their PR the best chance of getting merged.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reduce-the-burden-of-reviewing">Reduce the burden of reviewing<a href="#reduce-the-burden-of-reviewing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reduce the burden of reviewing" title="Direct link to Reduce the burden of reviewing">​</a></h3><p>You want reviewers to be able to focus on big-picture factors like the performance impact of a PR or alignment with project direction, not spending time on undifferentiated gruntwork. You can do this by ensuring you have extensive test coverage and automation wherever possible.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="communication">Communication<a href="#communication" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Communication" title="Direct link to Communication">​</a></h3><p>The PR (and related issue) is an act of communication. Both the contributor and the maintainers have a responsibility to communicate effectively.</p><p>Contributors should make very few assumptions about what the maintainers already know, and make it extremely easy to understand the context of the PR, the original problem, how the solution works, and any concerns.
Maintainers should ensure that communication is ongoing. Using bots to bump PRs for updates helps to remind reviewers that a PR is outstanding, but also reassures the PR author that it hasn’t been forgotten (<a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/pull/8671#issuecomment-1681197585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for example</a>).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="progress-over-perfection">Progress over perfection<a href="#progress-over-perfection" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Progress over perfection" title="Direct link to Progress over perfection">​</a></h3><p>You can always iterate after merging. If you spend too much time trying to get the PR perfect, a new contributor may get discouraged and never come back.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-merge-meeting">The merge meeting<a href="#the-merge-meeting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The merge meeting" title="Direct link to The merge meeting">​</a></h3><p>Even if you implement all of the above tactics successfully, sometimes knowing whether or not to merge a PR is hard. When people are uncertain, they will defer to others. Everyone can end up differing and nobody takes action.</p><p>To combat PR stagnation, FreeCAD has started having synchronous merge meetings including maintainers and contributors to discuss next steps on outstanding PRs. This live session is important and serves a number of purposes:</p><ul><li>Teasing out concerns and unspoken worry</li><li>Multiple contributors share the risk of merging a PR</li><li>Multiple perspectives put concerns into proper context</li><li>Multiple perspectives offer novel and productive outcomes</li></ul><p>Maintainers are referees in the meeting, making sure each contribution is evaluated according to the process. Did it start with an issue? Was there some consensus on the solution? Is the code passing CI?</p><p>We won’t hesitate to kick something back if a contributor blatantly ignores the process, but we try not to be militant and will merge good-faith contributions. Sometimes this means merging things we are (mildly) uncomfortable with because the contributor did everything by the book. When that happens, process says you merge.</p><p>What does this look like in practice?</p><ul><li>“Let’s ask <!-- -->[another contributor]<!-- --> for a code review, she knows about this module”</li><li>“This PR is really doing two different things. Let’s ask the author to split”</li><li>“This PR and that other one are in conflict. Let’s get those two people talking”</li><li>“This is low risk. Let’s merge it and see if anyone complains”</li><li>“This is a major feature and we’re close to a release. Let’s push this to the next milestone”</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="merge-meetings-help-us-move-faster-now-and-in-the-future">Merge meetings help us move faster now and in the future<a href="#merge-meetings-help-us-move-faster-now-and-in-the-future" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Merge meetings help us move faster now and in the future" title="Direct link to Merge meetings help us move faster now and in the future">​</a></h3><p>The value of these meetings is multifold. We clear a lot of our PR backlog quickly, avoiding the bystander effect that sometimes arises from having multiple reviewers assigned to a PR. We rely on early issues and the contributing policy to ‘push back’ on poorly implemented fixes and rushed code.</p><p>Apart from the immediate effects of getting more PRs merged faster, there are longer-term effects.</p><p>The merge meeting naturally encourages more discussion of milestone and release goals. We learn which maintainers have a ‘bigger picture’ of the project and community, and the ones who don’t get coaching by participating in the process. As you build consensus as a group, you expose and codify the implicit rules and standards that more experienced reviewers use in their assessment of PRs. By working together to agree on standards of what is acceptable, everyone builds their confidence.</p><p>The merge meeting is a good place for maintainers to learn:</p><ul><li>About the codebase</li><li>About the project’s policies and why they exist</li><li>To take appropriate risks</li><li>How to think about a contribution (maintainers learn from each other how to be better at evaluating code)</li><li>About the tools available in the platform</li></ul><p>It’s also a good place for contributors to learn about how merge decisions get made and to weigh in on others’ PRs (not just advocate for their own).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="join-us">Join us!<a href="#join-us" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Join us!" title="Direct link to Join us!">​</a></h2><p>The merge meetings are listed on <a href="https://www.freecad.org/events.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD community calendar</a> and are open to anyone.
Join the next merge meeting.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Historically, the duration of FreeCAD development cycles has been uneven, anywhere between a few months and 2+ years.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Timeline of FreeCAD releases" src="/assets/images/release-timeline-a7119bd419c9407666e8f25caa72c935.webp" width="1161" height="76" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We already talked about reasons and ways to make releases more predictable in <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-unpredictable-release-schedule-hurts-users-and-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the recent posts</a>. But the truth is, this is a much older conversation that has been going on in the community for years now: at FOSDEM, in the forum, and in various other venues and social channels. The hackathon in Vancouver was a perfect opportunity for the developers community to set some boundaries for v1.0.</p><p>We ended up formalizing a list of <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/roadmap/next.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4 major items</a> for the v1.0 roadmap that we think are a must-have to constitute the next release. None of these items are big news, we’ve all known about them for a while: the complete topological naming fix, a default Assembly workbench, a new implementation of a materials system, and the first-run wizard.</p><p>So let’s cast a quick glance at these items and talk about respective challenges.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-toponaming-fix">The toponaming fix<a href="#the-toponaming-fix" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The toponaming fix" title="Direct link to The toponaming fix">​</a></h2><p>We’ve already discussed this topic in the past, the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/milestone-toponaming-fix-phase-2-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest post from July</a> covers the current state of affairs in detail. It looks like we’ve already done a very difficult part of this project. Further work is not going to be easy, but the foundation for the next phases of the fix is sound.</p><p>The team is now approaching the third phase of the fix (out of five), there’s an <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/8432#issuecomment-1676433915" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">initial plan available</a>. As the third phase is where FreeCAD actually starts using the new toponaming infrastructure, this will be a perfect opportunity for new contributors to get involved. The <a href="https://t.me/toponamingchat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated Telegram chat</a> is the right place to start.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-default-assembly-workbench">The default Assembly workbench<a href="#the-default-assembly-workbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The default Assembly workbench" title="Direct link to The default Assembly workbench">​</a></h2><p>This is one of the more challenging items on the list of v1.0 deliverables. We think FreeCAD should have a capable assembly workbench and that really means two things:</p><ol><li>A workbench where the user configures the assembly, adding parts and establishing relationships between them.</li><li>A solver capable of resolving those relationships and moving the parts of the assembly appropriately.</li></ol><p>All that should be the default experience, no third-party add-ons.</p><p>Dr. Aik-Siong Koh, who is an employee at Ondsel, published the <a href="https://github.com/Ondsel-Development/OndselSolver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code of his solver</a> during the hackathon. This will be one of the foundations of the coming Assembly workbench.</p><p>For the user-facing assembly workbench, a lot of work remains. One of the challenges will be coming up with a user interface and workflow that are both discoverable, straightforward, and expandable. It doesn’t need to cover every use case.  Remember that the existing assembly options are still viable and may serve different users well. Rather the integrated solution should strive to be robust, simple to use, consistent with the rest of FreeCAD, and an excellent platform for future expansion.</p><p>The main challenge here will be building a team similar to the one we have for the TNP fix — a mix of Ondsel employees, FreeCAD maintainers, and 3rd party contributors. This has proven to be a great balance between interested parties, and we want to replicate that success.</p><p>The project will be managed as a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/7/views/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub project in the FreeCAD organization</a>, with cards and issues.  Similarly to the toponaming project, we’ll work in small incremental pull requests and merge the changes directly to the master branch rather than wait until the workbench is fully functional. An initial barebone implementation has already been merged to the main development branch.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="materials">Materials<a href="#materials" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Materials" title="Direct link to Materials">​</a></h2><p>The existing materials system in FreeCAD is overly simplistic, all over the place, and doesn’t even scratch the surface of what users really need it to do. So the program absolutely needs a solid foundation.</p><p>Earlier this year, we posted an <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-needs-a-better-materials-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">implementation proposal</a> for a new materials system written in collaboration with Dave Carter who volunteered to actually do the work. Dave is, in fact, knee-deep in that project and has made a lot of progress (the branch with his code is <a href="https://github.com/davesrocketshop/FreeCAD/tree/post_21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public</a>). Moreover, users have been <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=78242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very supportive</a> of his effort.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Editor for new material cards" src="/assets/images/materials-new-cards-editor-b1bae2dd4b5c40eea6bc33c2082c6ca8.webp" width="837" height="574" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The first pull request <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has already been filed</a> and is undergoing review. Further plan with materials is to apply the toponaming development model: break all further work down into small pieces, so that any developer could be part of that effort. Once the initial patch has been merged and further work has been decomposed into small items, more developers can join the effort. All further work will be done in pull requests. This will make it possible to deliver the minimum viable implementation in time for v1.0.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-run-wizard">First-run wizard<a href="#first-run-wizard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to First-run wizard" title="Direct link to First-run wizard">​</a></h2><p>FreeCAD has a difficult learning curve. Improving the initial user experiences is a topic that resurfaces regularly. We even covered that in a recent blog post. Here is the gist of the issue.</p><p>First of all, people can’t really agree on the scope of the first-run wizard. There are literally dozens of settings that users requested to be editable when you run the program for the first time. But when you dig deeper into the reasoning, several things become obvious.</p><p>First there are configuration settings for which a single default will never suffice. Language and the unit system are the two that come to mind.</p><p>Some configuration options appear to be personal preference but might also have more significant usability implications. For example themes and colors are personal preference, but they become extremely important if you suffer from color deficiency.  Users will never agree with each other about that, so those have to be easily configurable. </p><p>Other things that people want to configure should probably be solved in other ways. A great example of this is configuring which workbenches are available and active for a new user.
Should the system present a bewildering array of workbenches to a new user or should it hide potentially useful tools in an effort to be streamlined? Reasonable people disagree. In this case, the right answer might be to improve the Start workbench. This would provide a fast track to the workbench based on that task that they need to accomplish. Initial mockup was created and then turned into a <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull request</a> by Qewer during the hackathon. This patch has already been accepted and will be part of v1.0.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Updated start screen" src="/assets/images/updated-start-screen-43314754a338a6b5419904668bee5343.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>On yet another level, this is a conversation about terminology. A much-discussed example here is the distinction between Part and PartDesign — users inevitably learn to understand the difference, but they are off to a rocky start, and there are some technical issues to take care of on the developers’ part.</p><p>Hence the plan is to come up with a minimal implementation of the first-run wizard, one that would deal with things that users are split over regardless of how sensible defaults are, and then see take a holistic approach to dealing with the rest.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="and-now-the-fun-part-can-we-get-v10-out-by-fosdem-2024">And now the fun part: can we get v1.0 out by FOSDEM 2024?<a href="#and-now-the-fun-part-can-we-get-v10-out-by-fosdem-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to And now the fun part: can we get v1.0 out by FOSDEM 2024?" title="Direct link to And now the fun part: can we get v1.0 out by FOSDEM 2024?">​</a></h2><p>We think that these goals are within reach and it should be possible to release FreeCAD 1.0 in time for the next FOSDEM. Here’s our thinking behind this goal.</p><p>The TNP fix and the new Materials system are at the stage where the nature and the amount of work yet to be done are fairly predictable, and a large part of the heavy-lifting has already been done.</p><p>The initial Assembly workbench will be a challenging project, but now that we have a solver, we can start working on designing UX/UI around common use cases.</p><p>The design and the implementation of the first-run wizard itself would be a minor development effort, and there are people in the community who already spent a considerable amount of time creating mockups and even writing code. The challenging part will be taking a holistic approach to dealing with configuration and improving initial user experience, but we can make this effort span across multiple releases, there is so much to improve anyway.</p><p>To reiterate, v1.0 will definitely have changes apart from these 4 items. What we are aiming for is to start making development more predictable. Gaining some focus will help the team with both planning their work and managing expectations of FreeCAD users.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ethos of open-source software frequently finds itself at odds with the profit-driven dynamics of the modern tech landscape.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
-Mark 8:36</p></blockquote><p>Late last year I was talking with <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Core Ventures</a> about the possibility of starting Ondsel.  It was exciting to hear from people outside the FreeCAD community who shared the vision that this software was important and could be so much more than it already is. As the idea of actually starting a company took hold, the first important decision was which legal structure the new company would have. Two things that I read deeply affected me and shaped the final decision.</p><p>The first was <a href="https://www.cooleygo.com/delaware-public-benefit-corporation-is-it-right-for-you-a-five-part-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article by Jen Barnette that highlighted five considerations for being a public benefits corporation</a> (PBC).</p><p>At a time when ambition often clashes with integrity, the formation of Ondsel as a Public Benefit Company (PBC) should stand as a testament to our belief in conscious entrepreneurship. The ethos of open-source software, characterized by collaboration and transparency, frequently finds itself at odds with the profit-driven dynamics of the modern tech landscape. Ondsel's genesis as a PBC exemplifies a commitment to upholding the soul of open-source values, even in the pursuit of success.</p><p>Open-source software, a cornerstone of the digital age, embodies the spirit of sharing, transparency, and collective betterment. But, as projects mature, they can wrestle with the challenges of sustainability. Developers who once dedicated themselves to a project out of love find their efforts ensnared by financial considerations and proprietary boundaries, straying from the core essence of openness. Ondsel's inception as a PBC is a direct response—a proactive stance to prevent the dilution of these core values.</p><p>The five points that Jen described meshed well with my own thinking and I made sure to include them in <a href="https://ondsel.com/handbook/About/public_benefit_corp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our own handbook</a>. I revisit them often to make sure my thinking doesn’t drift away from the core values we started with.</p><p>The second thing I read was Simon Sinek’s book <a href="https://simonsinek.com/books/the-infinite-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Infinite Game</em></a>.  He suggests that a company should have a “just cause”  that inspires people because it explains <em>why</em> you’re doing what you do.</p><p>For me, this one was easy.</p><p>Human beings are creative and social creatures. Not everyone creates physical things but everyone is a maker of ideas. We enjoy sharing our ideas, talking about them and improving them. Sometimes those ideas turn into physical things that have beauty, utility, and value. These days, you need tools to express your ideas so others can build on them and we need everyone’s best ideas.</p><p>People deserve access to tools to help them express their ideas, share them with other people, and use them to produce useful things that benefit all of us. Ondsel wants to make powerful, efficient, and beautiful design tools available to more people.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FreeCAD is commonly criticized for being difficult to get started with. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quote 1" src="/assets/images/quote1-62e8e4811650f6e6373d08f546f83e18.webp" width="1421" height="199" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quote 2" src="/assets/images/quote2-9bdfb35d09fdf1d321bb9843df2bbe1f.webp" width="1421" height="199" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This criticism, while possibly overstated, is valid.</p><ul><li>Features get more development attention and the UX/UI design is usually an afterthought and “anything goes”. As a result, there’s not much consistency across the program.</li><li>The learning curve for modern CAD systems is a wall. There is even occasionally pushback against simplifying UX, because “CAD programs are <em>supposed</em> to be difficult and take a lot of time to learn". Effort to improve UI is seen as "dumbing it down”.</li><li>The program is trying to be many things at once: a 2D drafting program, a 3D design program, an Arch/BIM program, a CNC program, a structural analysis program — and that’s just a subset of workbenches available by default. All the while not much thought has been given to help users navigate the options when they see it for the first time, or customize FreeCAD for their use cases.</li><li>Terminology used in the program is inconsistent and confusing. Part vs PartDesign is one of the recurring topics in the community. But also “path” could mean a toolpath, a sweep path, or a file path depending on where in the program the word is used. These are just a couple examples.</li></ul><p>For a long time there have been calls for a first-run wizard (FRW) as the way to fix some of these problems. If you are not familiar with the concept, the idea behind FRW is a feature that runs the first time a user launches a program and helps orient the user to the software by allowing them to choose how the program will look and behave or by onboarding them in other ways.</p><p>While investigating this feature request, we looked into what other programs have to offer, and our conclusion is that while something is needed, this request is problematic and the specific solution has poor consensus.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-wrong-with-the-feature-request">What’s wrong with the feature request?<a href="#whats-wrong-with-the-feature-request" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s wrong with the feature request?" title="Direct link to What’s wrong with the feature request?">​</a></h2><p>First and foremost, the <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/5772" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue</a> is poorly defined. This issue predates the current contributing policy, it doesn’t start by identifying the problem but jumps immediately to the solution. People have seen similar solutions in other applications and have an intuition about them. But the notion of a first-run wizard brings different ideas to mind. In fact, our research showed that these tools are employed to address at least three different problems:</p><ul><li>User preferences make a big difference to usability but the settings are difficult to find or scattered in many places.</li><li>The optimum configuration of the software varies depending on the specific task the user is undertaking.</li><li>Important features are occasionally overlooked by users leading to frustration and increased support demand on the forum.</li></ul><p>These are three very different problems and their solutions are unlikely to be the same thing. It makes sense to address them independently.</p><p>Even if we narrow the focus and assume the feature request is only about customizing the software for the user’s needs, we still have a challenge. Consider this bewildering list of things that people have suggested should be configurable when you first run FreeCAD. We call it The Problematic Wishlist:</p><ul><li>Simple vs advanced layout (e.g. don’t show FEM workbench to a newbie, show less buttons in toolbars etc.)</li><li>Which workbenches (WBs) should be visible in the UI, with presets (Mechanical CAD, Arch/BIM etc.)</li><li>What WB is selected on startup</li><li>UI language</li><li>Units and unit schemes</li><li>Theme (dark/light/classic)</li><li>Enabling/disabling Treeview Glass theme</li><li>Icon theme</li><li>Highlight color</li><li>Icon size</li><li>Font size</li><li>Viewport background color</li><li>Navigation style</li><li>Enabling/disabling warnings in weekly builds</li><li>Enabling/disabling “What’s This?” button</li><li>Monitor aspect ratio selection for optimized layouts</li><li>Panel layout options</li><li>Default file storage location</li><li>Autosave and backup policy</li><li>Authoring and license info</li></ul><p>While it may be technically possible to implement all this in a first-run wizard,  it would be a perfect example of creating a bigger problem by trying to fix a smaller one.  It would be overwhelming to the user trying to get started and would complicate development since configuration would have to be maintained in both the FRW and the system preferences.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-other-programs-do">What other programs do<a href="#what-other-programs-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What other programs do" title="Direct link to What other programs do">​</a></h2><p>As part of the research phase, we looked at what other programs offer in terms of customizing UX the first time you run a program. The question we asked was just this: do other teams solve the same issues by offering a first-run wizard or do they do something else?</p><p>We started with CAD programs and then moved to other kinds of applications (3D modeling, image editing, vector graphics editing, audio production). Basically, any sophisticated program with lots of configuration options, aimed at professionals and designed for multiple use cases is worth looking at.</p><p>Right off the bat, among non-FOSS <strong>CAD</strong> packages, only BricsCAD provides something that vaguely approaches a first-run wizard. Every time you launch the program, a dialog asks what kind of work the user wants to do: 2D drafting, 3D modeling, mechanical design, or BIM. The same launcher window also asks whether the user wants metric or imperial units. And this is it. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Start screen in BricsCAD" src="/assets/images/bricscad-start-screen-7fab41fb6de424cef5f34bb217272b6b.webp" width="1420" height="946" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>But you don’t even need a dialog for that. Multiple programs provide a simple choice over the type of project you create. In some cases, it’s just a drop-down list of project types or a library of templates.</p><p>The only two programs that do have a first-run wizard are FOSS programs. LibreCAD asks for the default unit, GUI language, and command language. QCad asks for GUI language, default unit, default paper size, decimal point, and background color (black or white). Not too surprising, as the former is a fork of the latter.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="First-run wizard in LibreCAD" src="/assets/images/librecad-frw-3615f4974dfd0420b3b3bb9927b8051a.webp" width="1102" height="484" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The situation is pretty much the same across other industries we looked at.</p><p>Blender seems to be the only major <strong>3D modeling</strong> package that has a first-run wizard. You can set UI language, shortcuts preset, right-click vs left-click for selection, spacebar behavior, UI theme.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="First-run wizard in Blender" src="/assets/images/blender-frw-82c25b3c77508dffe5df53091f099492.webp" width="884" height="825" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>None of the big boys in <strong>image editing</strong>, like Adobe Photoshop and Affinity Photo, have a first-run wizard. Ironically, GIMP is the program that used to have one, got rid of it, but is likely to have one again. In short, the original wizard asked questions that could be automatically detected from various system settings, and users found it annoying. But then developers made changes to defaults (enforced default dark theme and symbolic/colorless icons, as well as grouped tool icons in the toolbar), and that, too, annoyed half the user base. So they want to reintroduce the first-run wizard at some point in the future.</p><p>Similarly, Inkscape seems to be the only <strong>vector graphics</strong> program with a first-run wizard: you can choose canvas look (transparent checkerboard, white opaque etc.), shortcuts theme, icons theme, dark vs system UI theme.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="First-run wizard in Inkscape" src="/assets/images/inkscape-frw-7f8a721255348eae90c578fa4febd3d3.webp" width="1403" height="1333" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Among proprietary <strong>digital audio workstations</strong> Cubase seems to be the only one that bothers users with questions, and even that during installation when you need to select a preferred audio interface. Once again, a FOSS program is an exception: the first time you run Ardour, a wizard asks for GUI and font scaling and the default folder for new sessions. The first part of that, however, is a toolkit limitation. Ardour still uses GTK2 for some part of its UI, and GTK2 is notoriously oblivious of HiDPI displays.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="First-run wizard in Ardour" src="/assets/images/ardour-frw-681f780085b156b00152d296962d0466.webp" width="760" height="542" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Across many industries, developers recognize that learning to use their software efficiently takes time, so they build links to training materials into the user interface. This is something FOSS developers are beginning to do, too. For example, MuseScore has links to educational videos on YouTube, and FreeCAD has links to the wiki.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Learning center in MuseScore" src="/assets/images/musescore-learning-center-76599ccbe989c6d526f0472515bbad3e.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So what did we learn from this?</p><ul><li><strong>Very few programs actually provide a first-run wizard.</strong> Proprietary programs typically enforce a certain choice of defaults even for controversial things like the look and feel, but, to their credit, usually make it rather easy to customize certain things.</li><li><strong>There are obvious polarizing topics.</strong> Some of the defaults are things that users just can’t stop arguing about. This is exactly what first-run wizards in FOSS programs like Blender and Inkscape focus on.</li><li><strong>Measure units surprisingly do not cause all that much controversy.</strong> Figuring out the right units from locale settings is perfectly doable, so it’s possible that this is why very few CAD programs even bother exposing those when you run them the first time or create a new project. Typically, there is a global configuration that applies to new projects and a simple way to override it on a per-project basis (an unfinished patch for the latter <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exists</a> for FreeCAD).</li><li><strong>There’s usually a very obvious way to get to the right tools.</strong> Applications like Inventor make it very easy to create a 2D design or a 3D model. Usually, it’s just one or two clicks away, and the UI for that is in a very obvious place.</li><li><strong>CAD programs usually have a learning center for newly arrived users.</strong> This is something FreeCAD already does, but there are ways to improve it. A topic for another day.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Learning center in Autocad LT" src="/assets/images/autocad-lt-learning-center-01cdd9a60a51c2e7812d8769545c5c43.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-proposal">Our proposal<a href="#our-proposal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our proposal" title="Direct link to Our proposal">​</a></h2><p>Based on our findings, we think it’s best to attack the issue of suboptimal first user experience from three angles: minimal first-run wizard, better defaults, and continuous UX/UI improvement.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="minimal-first-run-wizard">Minimal first-run wizard<a href="#minimal-first-run-wizard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Minimal first-run wizard" title="Direct link to Minimal first-run wizard">​</a></h3><p>Let’s learn from the experience of other projects. Right-click selection in Blender was a huge annoyance for new users right up to the point where left-click selection was finally implemented and the first-run wizard started offering the choice between the two options. The lesson here is that there will always be things that users are split over, we are not going to change everyone’s mind, ever.</p><p>Therefore the first part of the solution is to build a minimalistic first-run wizard that will cover just that: visual style, navigation style, units, GUI language. We can further refine the wizard based on feedback from users. Designing and implementing the dialog is not too complicated, and there have been several approaches to do so already.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="better-defaults">Better defaults<a href="#better-defaults" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Better defaults" title="Direct link to Better defaults">​</a></h3><p>Certain things on the wishlist above could absolutely be better defaults. For example, we can enable backups by default and set a sensible number of versions to be saved.</p><p>The tricky part here is coming up with a definition of what constitutes a sensible default. This is something we will have to further explore.</p><p>In our experience, it’s useful to keep each conversation about defaults narrowly focused. For example, we’ve already had a lively if slightly heated discussion over disabling some of the workbenches in the workbench selector by default. Breaking that conversation into several dedicated GitHub issues has helped to keep the discussion productive, so now there is a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub project</a> for cleaning up the workbench selector.</p><p>This task of making good defaults will likely never be 100% completed as FreeCAD keeps changing. So we should treat it as a continuous effort.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="continuous-uxui-improvement">Continuous UX/UI improvement<a href="#continuous-uxui-improvement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Continuous UX/UI improvement" title="Direct link to Continuous UX/UI improvement">​</a></h3><p>This last part of the solution is a lot more interesting. Let’s analyze the rest and see how we can improve the UX/UI to deliver a better initial user experience and maybe remove the need for configuring certain things when users run the program for the first time.</p><p>Here is an example. One of the ideas for the first-run wizard is to allow users to configure what workbenches they want visible by default. To reiterate, someone who, for all we know, is probably looking at the program for the first time, is supposed to somehow guess what workbenches they actually need without having ever used them. That doesn’t sound like a very likely scenario.</p><p>And then some experienced users could have different uses for the program. You can be an architect who needs Draft, Arch/BIM, and just a few more WBs. But you also tinker with stuff in your spare time, so PartDesign and Path are no strangers to you.</p><p>Basically, FreeCAD needs to adapt the UI based on context. There are several established approaches to deal with that. Named workspaces is one of them. But another approach is to improve the start screen. If you create an architectural project, you automatically get a certain set of workbenches available to you. You can further refine that selection, if you want to, but the default user experience will already be streamlined for you to a large extent based on the type of a project you create.</p><p>The first step towards that has already been done. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Qewer</a>, v1.0 will be coming with an update start screen listing several typical new projects that are basically a fast track to a particular workbench.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="New start page in FreeCAD" src="/assets/images/freecad-new-start-page-8504802fe5942707cae5aaa1488034ec.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The full implementation of that would eliminate two items from the wishlist: 1) what WBs should be visible in the UI, and 2) what WB is selected on startup.</p><p>This kind of a holistic approach to designing UX/UI should serve the project much better than what we have had so far. We also don’t have to deliver the full UX/UI redesign of FreeCAD for v1.0, this kind of refinement can go on for as many development cycles as we can handle.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next" title="Direct link to What’s next">​</a></h2><p>Improving the user’s initial experience of FreeCAD is not a single work effort.  There has been good work done in this area already including an <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/5772" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing discussion</a> about the first-run wizard in the issue tracker, but discrete, solvable issues need to be extracted from that and solutions built for each of them.</p><p>The first issue to address is the narrowly defined set of configuration options  which users routinely disagree about: language, units, navigation style, and theme.</p><p>Tailoring the application to the task should be addressed by improving the start page and providing better defaults whenever possible.  As noted above, some work has already been done.</p><p>That leaves the more subjective work of explicitly educating the user about FreeCAD conventions, UI tools, shortcuts, and the general UX/UI improvements.   Both of these need more research and feedback from the community. This is an area where we need better and more actionable data from community power users and moderators about where users are confused.</p><p>There will likely be a GitHub project focusing on UX/UI cleanup. Stay tuned for more news on that.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Getting a contribution merged as an amateur or hobbyist is no small feat, and yet we rarely take the time to acknowledge and celebrate when this happens.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Besides working on <a href="https://ondsel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ondsel</a>, I mostly work on the <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Path_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Path Workbench</a>. Path has a unique user base made up of hobbyists and machinists. These people are using Path to generate G-code for the CNC machines and the code almost always has to be tailored for a specific machine.</p><p>Once you’ve edited the G-code once or twice, it’s natural to want to customize your postprocessor and that means editing a little Python code. Occasionally, one step leads to another and the user wants to contribute their changes ‘upstream’ so they can be used by others. It’s a common story and is, in fact, exactly how I got involved in open-source development.</p><p>As a maintainer of FreeCAD, I’ve spoken to lots of first-time contributors. I generally coach them through the PR process rather than doing it for them. Once they get a PR merged, they get a real thrill from it. It feels good to contribute something to a project.</p><p>Open-source projects are always encouraging users to step up and become contributors. Getting a contribution merged as an amateur or hobbyist is no small feat, and yet we rarely take the time to acknowledge and celebrate when this happens.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="you-pay-time-for-free-software">You pay time for free software<a href="#you-pay-time-for-free-software" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to You pay time for free software" title="Direct link to You pay time for free software">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>“I sometimes have the feeling that far too much work went into explaining things to people who did not want to learn FreeCAD, but who wanted to have FreeCAD be like their favourite CAD system, which they were not willing to pay for.”—<a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=577071#p577071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chrisb on the FreeCAD forum</a></p></blockquote><p>FreeCAD is not just a free to use version of your preferred CAD system. By choosing open source, especially younger projects, you accept that the product or tool may not be fully formed yet.</p><p>The experience of using an open-source alternative like FreeCAD vs. a proprietary product can be frustrating. The common objections are the absence of a slick and intuitive UI, and missing documentation. The nature of open-source projects is that they aren’t optimized for attracting new users:</p><blockquote><p>“FreeCAD has no goal of market penetration or profit, nor of training neophytes. FreeCAD has always been a sandbox. What the user sees is the current culmination of sandcastles people have built over the years. It is organic, so the sand castles aren’t necessarily designed to be completely stand alone … There is no holistic design or guidance...it is organic. Many see this as something built on a shifting base, but, somehow thousands of people around the world manage to get things done.</p><p>For better or worse, there are no bounds on what or how the sandcastles are built. It takes some time and effort to learn how to navigate the sandcastles, and in some cases the moats around them. Some are willing to put in this effort, others chafe, for many reasons.”—<a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=577121#p577121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drmacro on the FreeCAD forum</a></p></blockquote><p>When you get software for free, you pay in effort and time instead. What do you get by making that trade? Whether you’re a hobbyist creator or trying to adopt FreeCAD for your workplace, the greater benefits of FreeCAD include:</p><ul><li>Not being <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-adoption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">locked into a subscription</a> model from a capricious vendor</li><li>Complete transparency to both inspect the code and see the roadmap for future developments</li><li>You can work on your local machine instead of being tied to a web application</li><li><em>You can influence the product</em> </li></ul><p>You can have an impact on the velocity and trajectory of the project. The inconvenience of an immature feature set or lack of finesse might be uncomfortable at first, but the things you create with FreeCAD are yours, forever. Beyond the practical and tangible benefits, you also might get:</p><ul><li>A sense of ownership</li><li>A sense of accomplishment</li><li>Your name written into the Git history of the project</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contributing-to-open-source-isnt-easy">Contributing to open source isn’t easy<a href="#contributing-to-open-source-isnt-easy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contributing to open source isn’t easy" title="Direct link to Contributing to open source isn’t easy">​</a></h2><p>It’s not my intention to downplay the effort required. Contributing to open source and shaping the direction of a project can be fun and rewarding, but it’s also difficult and <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/contribution-barriers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can be intimidating for newcomers</a>. A lot of open-source contributors are professional, formally trained developers. As an amateur or hobbyist, contributing is both technically challenging and a feat in overcoming imposter syndrome. </p><p>It takes courage to propose changes and improvements, especially to code contributed by people who do it for a living. Nobody wants to be shot down and told to go fork the project. We’ve discussed <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/better-github-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the responsibility of project maintainers in fostering a more welcoming environment</a> on this blog before, and there’s an equal responsibility on the contributors to be humble and receptive to feedback. </p><p>Still, I have seen firsthand <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24514839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how meaningful and satisfying it is for newcomers to get their contributions merged</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="come-to-solve-your-own-problems-stay-for-the-legacy">Come to solve your own problems, stay for the legacy<a href="#come-to-solve-your-own-problems-stay-for-the-legacy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Come to solve your own problems, stay for the legacy" title="Direct link to Come to solve your own problems, stay for the legacy">​</a></h2><p>For people used to working with proprietary software and hardware, it’s novel to be able to contribute a solution to a problem you’re having, and also make that solution available to others. Beyond the immediate dopamine hit of getting your fix merged for you and other FreeCAD users to enjoy, there’s a lasting impact. </p><p>For most of human history, when people worked together to build something, they had to be in the same place at the same time. They <a href="https://historycollection.com/not-average-neighborhood-graffiti-12-mysterious-graffiti-works-history-mean/9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">left behind</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_(1980_video_game)#Easter_egg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">traces of their work</a> and archeologists study those traces to understand what life was like. We’re in the very earliest days of remote collaborative work—where hundreds or thousands of people contribute to creating something. They span cultures, languages, time, and place.</p><p>The nature of the Git repo is that the commit history is permanent and there’s a million copies of it. We’ve only been working on software like this for a few decades and with the millions of copies, some of them are likely to survive for a very, VERY long time.</p><p>In the far distant future, the equivalent of archeologists will sift through old data to reconstruct the history of what happened in the past. Just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William Rathje studies modern garbage</a>, someone will eventually get the idea to systematically study Git histories to understand the culture of distributed work and collaborative software development.</p><p>Our contributions may be more timeless than we realize.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Laptop with Stickers" src="/assets/images/laptopstickers-d49faf5314671ebbd674ecc03552cc8c.jpg" width="1274" height="834" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="addendum-heres-something-i-would-love-to-see">Addendum: Here’s something I would love to see...<a href="#addendum-heres-something-i-would-love-to-see" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Addendum: Here’s something I would love to see..." title="Direct link to Addendum: Here’s something I would love to see...">​</a></h2><p>If there’s anyone from GitHub or GitLab reading, you could make it easier for open-source projects to reward contributors. As a maintainer of FreeCAD I would love to be able to push a button and send a coupon to a first-time contributor. They could redeem the coupon for a sticker with the FreeCAD (Ondsel) logo. This sticker wouldn’t be available to just anyone. Nope. The only way to get one is to contribute to the project. It’s special.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that the new major release is out, it's time for us to reflect on our experience participating in a FreeCAD development cycle as a business.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FreeCAD 0.21 has just been released with numerous new features and improvements. Some of the Ondsel team members have been regular contributors to FreeCAD for many years, but this is the first time we participated in a development cycle as a commercial entity. Let’s take this opportunity to step back and reflect on it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="working-with-the-freecad-community">Working with the FreeCAD community<a href="#working-with-the-freecad-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Working with the FreeCAD community" title="Direct link to Working with the FreeCAD community">​</a></h2><p>We’ve known people who are active in the community for many years, and our interactions have been great for the most part. But at the back of our minds there was this nagging thought: can we keep it that way as a company?</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Jedi PR merging" src="/assets/images/sw-meme-dc45ba5e15e664a34fc773b599e5a8a0.webp" width="500" height="500" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Now that we’ve had this (however short) run with 0.21 development and release, it looks like the answer is a very definite ‘yes’. The user community has been nothing short of awesome. The maintainers have been professional, supportive and responsive, same as usual.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="concerns-and-response">Concerns and Response<a href="#concerns-and-response" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Concerns and Response" title="Direct link to Concerns and Response">​</a></h2><p>As a commercial company, our biggest concern was predictability in the development process.  We wanted to know … <em>needed</em> to know… that effort we spend on development wouldn’t be wasted. We also had to have some assurance that releases would happen in time to support our corporate goals. </p><p>Early on, we raised our concern that the development methodology was too unpredictable.  It wasn’t clear which pull requests would be accepted or even who would make the decision. Pull requests would often get stuck in limbo or even denied after significant work was done. For a new startup, the risk of that happening was too great. The core developers and maintainers responded by implementing a <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clear policy for contributing</a> to the FreeCAD source and defined how those contributions would be handled.</p><p>Another major concern was how dependent the project had become on individual expertise.  Many important things were not documented and only lived in the minds of key people. In some cases only a few people knew how to do key tasks, and losing those people from the project was a major risk. The community agreed, and that’s one of the reasons we are heavily invested in building the <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer’s Handbook</a> in collaboration with Chris Hennes, WandererFan, and other FreeCAD contributors and members of the <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Project Association</a>.</p><blockquote><p>I think as a team we made tremendous strides during the 0.21 cycle, particularly in formalizing the role of a maintainer and setting clearer expectations about what maintainers are responsible for. The creation of the Developer Handbook was a major step forward for all of us, as was the creation of CONTRIBUTING.md. We still have more work to do actually implementing the ideals in those documents, but at least having the goals written down is a big step forward. — Chris Hennes, FreeCAD maintainer, the FPA board member and founder</p></blockquote><p>Implementing the policies and starting the handbook helped, but even with the best intentions and tools, development is <em>hard</em>. The FreeCAD project has a lot of contributors, just keeping track of the release, issues, and pull requests was taxing everyone.  </p><p>We started investigating the functionality GitHub provides to manage <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projects</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/discussions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussions</a>.  We used this first for the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toponaming project</a> and then, with the addition of Milestones, we started the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Release Dashboard</a> to give everyone a clear picture of where we are on the current release.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="1.0 release dashboard on GitHub" src="/assets/images/release-dashboard-4f81a69a64acfb23b460a85e1896ac30.webp" width="2687" height="1157" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The dashboard is helping to focus attention but PRs still sit too long.  Even with clear accountability for maintainers, it is often difficult to know if a given PR <em>should</em> be merged. Nobody is expert on everything, and merge decisions often come with a certain amount of risk. Lately the maintainers have started addressing this by reviewing the outstanding PR queue as a group in live meetings. Individual PRs are discussed and decisions made in realtime. Often PRs get merged immediately. Others get flagged for followup or moved to a later milestone. The decision about how to proceed is shared with many people contributing wisdom.  </p><blockquote><p>Now we have a much, much clearer, predictable, foreseeable and transparent process that can be (and has been) undertaken by more people. This is a very important step towards having more regular releases in the future. — Yorik Van Havre, Arch and BIM maintainer, the FPA chairperson and founder</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-freecad-truly-needs-is-a-shared-vision">What FreeCAD truly needs is… a shared vision<a href="#what-freecad-truly-needs-is-a-shared-vision" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What FreeCAD truly needs is… a shared vision" title="Direct link to What FreeCAD truly needs is… a shared vision">​</a></h2><p>FreeCAD development still has its challenges. We still don’t have broad consensus on where the application goes from here. Since its beginning, the project has proceeded forward with developers working on whichever features they were interested in. That’s part of the appeal of an open-source project, and we hope it never changes. A clear roadmap, however, would give some structure and help avoid conflict. There are some humble beginnings of a <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roadmap</a>, but it still needs further work.</p><p>Lots of discussion happened during the 0.21 development cycle that helped clarify the road to v1.0. Some of these topics we’ve already written about extensively on this blog, including <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assembly</a> and <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-needs-a-better-materials-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>. Other ideas, like a first-run wizard, have gotten some preliminary attention but need more planning and discussion. We are looking forward to the upcoming hackathon in Vancouver as an opportunity to further refine the roadmap.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wins-and-challenges-for-the-entire-freecad-team">Wins and challenges for the entire FreeCAD team<a href="#wins-and-challenges-for-the-entire-freecad-team" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wins and challenges for the entire FreeCAD team" title="Direct link to Wins and challenges for the entire FreeCAD team">​</a></h2><p><strong>The FreeCAD community is getting bigger and more spread-out.</strong> We now have a wide range of experts on many topics, which is great for a better understanding of problems users have and thus finding better solutions. At the same time, it’s now harder to get consensus and to get the word out about initiatives.</p><blockquote><p>There were several high points for me in 0.21. One of those was the help I got from members of the community: some contributed code, some did testing, some explained the arcania of technical drawing. — WandererFan, TechDraw maintainer, the FPA board member and founder</p></blockquote><p><strong>The FPA really came into its own.</strong> Donations from end users have been strong and reflect how much the greater community wants to see FreeCAD succeed. But an important challenge for the FPA going forward is managing these donations effectively. There’s no doubt that paid-development and contract work will be part of the future.</p><blockquote><p>I think we are making a better work of organizing for a release. The presence of the FPA and the development grants are opening up opportunities that where previously not there and it’s giving some good initial results, I expect this to only get better next cycle! — Adrián Insaurralde Avalos, maintainer and release manager of FreeCAD</p></blockquote><p><strong>The project is getting better at taking feedback.</strong> Improving the contribution process made us focus much more on getting good feedback from users: Conversations are now happening increasingly often in pull requests and issues on GitHub. The team also did a very successful <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=658200#p658200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complaints session</a> at FOSDEM this year. Overall, the improvement is in the quality of discussions. Once you formulate an issue as a problem to be solved, you end up with atomic tasks that are easier to accomplish. The inevitable challenge here is that now the project has a backlog of existing issues that need to be refactored and tailored to this new way of dealing with issues.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-ondsel-is-doing-and-whats-next">What Ondsel is doing and what’s next<a href="#what-ondsel-is-doing-and-whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Ondsel is doing and what’s next" title="Direct link to What Ondsel is doing and what’s next">​</a></h2><p>Ondsel is building a service that makes FreeCAD more usable and useful to commercial users and teams.  We absolutely need FreeCAD to be the kind of software that people rave about and can’t recommend enough. So we spend a lot of time improving it for users.</p><p>Our visible contributions to v0.21 were mostly improving the user interface and workflow.  We made contributions to the Preferences dialog, improved the UX/UI of Fillet, Chamfer, Draft, and Thickness tools in the Part Design workbench. We redesigned the image plane settings and fixed bugs in the core and the Path workbench.</p><p>Many of our contributions are less visible.  We have also been working on larger projects that will also benefit the entire ecosystem but will take longer to bear fruit.</p><p>We’re leading the project to integrate RealThunder’s fix for the notorious toponaming issue. The first 2 phases out of 5 are now complete (see this <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/milestone-toponaming-fix-phase-2-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent blog post</a> about it).</p><p>After <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">researching existing options</a> for creating and solving assemblies in FreeCAD, we settled on writing a solver of our own. Dr. Aik-Siong Koh has made significant progress towards a assembly solver based on his existing code originally written in Smalltalk. So far, the new solver can create an assembly and perform kinematics of a piston-crank system. We are also looking for ways to integrate <a href="https://www.mbdyn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MBDyn</a> for multi-body dynamics.</p><p>Ajinkya Dahale has a working prototype of a native custom data elements system, one that doesn’t require using 3rd party workbenches or abusing PropertyBag from the Path workbench (see our original research for an <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/build-system-for-custom-data-elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overview of available options</a>).</p><p>In conclusion, what we can say with absolute certainty is that, as a company, we feel that working on FreeCAD is fulfilling and rewarding. We hope that more companies creating FreeCAD-based products and services will join the development.

        <updated>2023-07-24T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been working with the FreeCAD community on mitigating the topological naming issue for the past half a year. It's time for a progress update.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in February, we <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-topological-naming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> an explanation of the toponaming issue in FreeCAD and a proposal of getting this fixed in the upstream project, with RealThunder’s LinkStage3 fork as a guideline. Since then, we’ve made a lot of progress, but even more work is yet to be done.</p><p>In this post, we’d like to explain how we are separating this work into stages, why FreeCAD 0.21 is not going to be much different from previous releases in terms of toponaming, and what our plan for the next development cycle is.</p><p>While this progress is cause to celebrate, we also caution users to understand that models can (and will) break for reasons besides toponaming even after this project is done.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-this-toponaming-thing-anyway">What’s this toponaming thing anyway?<a href="#whats-this-toponaming-thing-anyway" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s this toponaming thing anyway?" title="Direct link to What’s this toponaming thing anyway?">​</a></h2><p>As models evolve, their geometry changes. Doing a boolean sum of the same object with a different object will create new faces and vertices. So if a feature is attached to an element that no longer exists, the model will break. Topological naming is a way to store all element names in a persistent manner to avoid that scenario. You can read a much more detailed explanation in the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-topological-naming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</a>. The important thing here is that making topology names persistent implies changing FreeCAD’s source code in many places and the changes are not trivial. This is not a fix you can do on a lazy Sunday afternoon.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-tnp-team">The TNP team<a href="#the-tnp-team" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The TNP team" title="Direct link to The TNP team">​</a></h2><p>Before we go any further, let's introduce the team that has been working on the fix all year so far.</p><p>John Dupuy is an Ondsel employee. He’s project coordinator, does code review, as well as his own share of programming.</p><p>Chris Hennes is FreeCAD maintainer who also writes code and does code review from other contributors. He did a large part of programming in phases 1 and 2 of the TNP fix (more on that below).</p><p>Pesc0 is a new arrival to FreeCAD. When the call for participation at fixing the TNP issue was posted, he picked a few tasks he was interested in, started hacking and — most importantly — didn’t drop the ball. He also turned out to be really great at communication with the team.</p><p>Zheng Lei aka RealThunder (or RT) developed the fix for the toponaming issue in his fork of FreeCAD. His patchset made it possible for the upstream team to study the issue in much more detail, explore possible solutions, and come up with a roadmap. The TNP team uses a lot of his code and the classes he developed. RealThunder was involved in a consulting role and provided some really useful insight.</p><p>Ajinkya Dahale is an active contributor to the project, and employee at Ondsel. His involvement so far is creating the fix for sketch objects.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="staging-the-fix">Staging the fix<a href="#staging-the-fix" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Staging the fix" title="Direct link to Staging the fix">​</a></h2><p>After studying the issue and the existing fix in RealThunder’s fork, we came up with a plan to introduce topological naming in five phases.</p><p>Phase 1: To begin, we need a way to store and manipulate short references names of elements and names serialized from the element mapping. We also need a way to handle element naming as a whole and store all descriptive elements in one place for easy reference. So this is where we wrote several classes — <code>IndexedName.cpp</code> (save the name of an element), <code>MappedName.cs</code> (store and manipulate the more-complex mapped-name used by elements and the toponaming algorithm), <code>MappedElement.cpp</code> class (save the name parts of an element), <code>ElementMap.h</code> (store all descriptive elements in one place for easy reference).</p><p>Phase 2: The main objective of this phase is to create a way to generatively express the history of an item, create new names and mappings, but not actually rely on them. This phase mainly touches Sketch and Part workbenches.</p><p>This is where we are now. Version 0.21 is coming out soon with stage 1 and stage 2 implemented. Some smaller items remain to be completed.</p><p>Phase 3: This is where we will start applying new names and mappings to geometry elements. We expect that at this point, until optimizations are done, FreeCAD will become somewhat slower. This expected performance regression is one of the main reasons we are not waiting for the entire work to be done to release a new FreeCAD version.</p><p>Phase 4: At this stage, we are planning to start using the new names when recalculating objects in all workbenches.</p><p>Phase 5: This final stage is where we do all the optimization to make FreeCAD fast and snappy while toponaming-safe.</p><p>The plan is to do phases 3 through 5 in the next development cycle leading up to releasing v1.0 some time next year.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="will-toponaming-solve-all-the-problems-with-models-breaking-nope">Will toponaming solve all the problems with models breaking? Nope.<a href="#will-toponaming-solve-all-the-problems-with-models-breaking-nope" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Will toponaming solve all the problems with models breaking? Nope." title="Direct link to Will toponaming solve all the problems with models breaking? Nope.">​</a></h2><p>There are multiple other opportunities for models to break even when toponaming is not involved. A common reason for that is using relative rather than absolute references when constraining elements of sketches. With relative references, FreeCAD will likely try to solve constraints in a different order, which will change geometry.</p><p>A certain combination of parameters can cause inversion of a part of a sketch. So when you e.g. change a parameter driven via spreadsheet, it will break your model forever, and you won't be able to undo and/or recompute.</p><p>FreeCAD also does no validation of user input by itself. It will obediently do whatever the user asks it to do, even if it makes the model explode. This can be worked around by using conditional expressions to normalize user-submitted values that don't make sense.</p><p>Brodie Fairhall covered these and a few other cases in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp6cIMA7LsI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> for FreeCAD User Conference 2023. We highly recommend watching it!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-work-on-the-tnp-fix-changed-the-project">How work on the TNP fix changed the project<a href="#how-work-on-the-tnp-fix-changed-the-project" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How work on the TNP fix changed the project" title="Direct link to How work on the TNP fix changed the project">​</a></h2><p>As a developers community, we’ve already made complex changes to FreeCAD in the past, like switching from Python 2.7 to Python 3, or porting the user interface from Qt 4 to Qt5. But the way we planned that work wasn’t great. Fixing the toponaming issue rivals past challenging projects in virtually every aspect, so it was time to change our approach to planning our work.
To do that, we decided to use GitHub’s projects feature, break the entire project into phases, and, most importantly, avoid trying to complete the entire project within one development cycle.</p><p>Another major change was making unit tests the norm. Until fairly recently, FreeCAD had zero unit tests. It was really bad, because it made discovering and fixing regressions quite a bit of a nightmare. Some work on that had started shortly before our work on TNP began, but we made it the rule that all new code should come with unit tests.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-conclusion">In conclusion<a href="#in-conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to In conclusion" title="Direct link to In conclusion">​</a></h2><p>Seeing a new contributor pick up rather complex tasks and work on them until the job is done has been one of the most rewarding experiences in this project so far. We would definitely appreciate more people following in the footsteps of Pesc0.</p><p>Here is what you can do. Most of the project conversation is taking place in a <a href="https://t.me/toponamingchat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated Telegram group</a>. The group has be-weekly teleconferences discussing progress and issues. The task list is discussed and built in <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/8432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub issue 8432</a> and new issues are made for each task. You can volunteer for one of those, create a PR, copy in the code from the toponaming branch, then start writing tests to build your understanding of what the code is doing, and iteratively accomplish the task.</p><p>This isn’t the easiest project to accomplish, and as FreeCAD v1.0 release is directly dependent on finalizing the toponaming fix, we encourage all interested developers to join us!</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2023-07-11T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many ideas how to help FOSS developer earn a living. Bounties are a common solution, but they barely ever work, while better alternatives exist.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Funding free/libre software projects is difficult. For the last 5+ years, the knee jerk reaction has been to say “just do what Blender Foundation does, they got everything right”. But contributors come with different backgrounds. Some are perfectly fine about thinking like entrepreneurs, others would rather stick to programming, or designing interfaces, or bug triaging, or writing documentation etc.</p><p>So there are various ideas on how to work around that and still help teams earn a living. One idea we come across really often is bounties. The general idea of a bounty is this: someone identifies an issue and offers some money to fix it, other people can bring more money, then someone implements a fix or a feature and takes the money.</p><p>FreeCAD has a mixed history with bounties. People absolutely mean well when they suggest bounties as a way to foster development of free and open-source software (FOSS), but bounties fail way too often. Nevertheless, there's a popular notion that they are actually great. And thus bounties distract people from trying more realistic solutions.</p><p>Let's talk about why bounties fail and what approaches to funding FOSS developers are better and why.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-bounties-and-where-do-they-actually-work">What are the bounties and where do they actually work?<a href="#what-are-the-bounties-and-where-do-they-actually-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are the bounties and where do they actually work?" title="Direct link to What are the bounties and where do they actually work?">​</a></h2><p>First and foremost, let’s clarify that the bounties we are referring here to are the bounties typically proposed by users. The bounties paid by corporations for finding e.g. security vulnerabilities in their products are a whole different topic.</p><p>The unsophisticated look at bounties, that you can find on forums and elsewhere, is basically this: we think there’s a great feature to implement, we are willing to pay what we think is a fair amount of money to cover the cost of its development, someone will absolutely volunteer, because, well, here is our money for the taking.</p><p>As far as these simple agreements go, it works in a limited amount of scenarios:</p><ul><li><strong>Small bug fixes.</strong> Many large software projects have hundreds of small issues that the core team just never has the time to fix. It could be incomplete file format support or a number of sorely missing settings. In other words, nothing that requires digging a ten thousand feet deep hole into the source code just to find out that half of the application needs to be rewritten, possibly in a new fancy programming language.</li><li><strong>Small features.</strong> Similarly, a new feature that doesn’t affect workflows in any major way and doesn’t impose major internal redesign, could be subject to a bounty.</li><li><strong>3rd party add-ons.</strong> Developing an add-on or a macro that automates a daunting task could be a bounty material, especially if the use case in question is not a typical one and thus would likely not be covered by what a program does by default.</li></ul><p>Everything else typically becomes a problem with bounties. Here is why.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-a-more-realistic-scenario">What’s a more realistic scenario?<a href="#whats-a-more-realistic-scenario" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s a more realistic scenario?" title="Direct link to What’s a more realistic scenario?">​</a></h2><p>When you start treating anything as a bounty material, in a large project like FreeCAD, the bounty scenario needs to be more like this:</p><ol><li>Someone singles out an issue that could be fixed with a bounty.</li><li>The stakeholders agree that it is indeed a bounty material.</li><li>Someone spends time to evaluate the cost of a project, with a realistic error margin.</li><li>The evaluation is then adjusted for the time spent on the preliminary evaluation before any real work starts.</li><li>Both the stakeholders and the community agree that the evaluation is ok.</li><li>The community puts their money where their mouth is.</li><li>Work gets done.</li><li>The community accepts the results after some or no development iterations.</li><li>The evaluation is then adjusted for actual development expenses, and the community accepts that and pays for it too, because the developer shouldn't be punished for things out of their control.</li></ol><p>You’ll notice that in this scenario, real-life expenses are taken into account (and paid in full), because figuring out the right solution is often 80% of the entire work. Moreover, everyone seems to agree on everything, which is so often not the case. An even more unthinkable thing happens: the bounty is adjusted for actual expenses — most bounty platforms don’t even handle that, and the protocol of the adjustment is pretty much unheard of.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-why-do-bounties-fail-exactly">So why do bounties fail exactly?<a href="#so-why-do-bounties-fail-exactly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So why do bounties fail exactly?" title="Direct link to So why do bounties fail exactly?">​</a></h2><p>There are so many reasons. Let’s dig into some of them.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="financial-reasons">Financial reasons<a href="#financial-reasons" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Financial reasons" title="Direct link to Financial reasons">​</a></h3><p>Things start to break at the very beginning. When a bounty is initiated by a user, their idea of development cost will likely be way off. <strong>It takes a certain amount of familiarity with the source code</strong> in question to be able to make a fair estimation, and even then there’s no guarantee that larger underlying issues won’t be discovered.</p><p>One example here would be canvas rotation in <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIMP</a>. This feature was originally implemented in a fork called <a href="https://github.com/seagetch/gimp-painter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIMP-Painter</a>. A popular online platform <a href="https://bountysource.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BountySource</a> had a bounty for that exact feature, with close to EUR 75.00 waiting for someone to backport the patch. But when one of GIMP developers started looking into this, he found out he would have to pretty much write that feature from scratch — it was <em>that</em> much easier than normalizing the patch. What looked like a ‘git cherry-pick’ material turned out to be a hack lasting several days and looking more like a EUR 750.00 job. So when he, an experienced developer, picked the bounty, it was less than minimum per-hour wage in his country of residence. That is simply not sustainable.</p><p>An even more staggering example of a financial failure of a bounty are MIDI tracks in <a href="https://ardour.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ardour</a>. This essential feature was available as a bounty and was eventually developed over the course of two Google Summer of Code seasons, with multiple people participating (GSoC student, his mentor and lead developer of the project, a UX/UI designer). They spent close to 3 years working on this on and off. How much money was pledged? $1,380.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="organizational-reasons">Organizational reasons<a href="#organizational-reasons" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Organizational reasons" title="Direct link to Organizational reasons">​</a></h3><p><strong>Bounties rarely scale.</strong> While some patches only need understanding the source code and being able to design a solution, others require getting more people like UX/UI architects involved.</p><p><strong>Efforts can be duplicated.</strong> With bounties, developers are asked to take all the risks. Several people can work on the same solution at once, only one of them will be paid.</p><p><strong>Payment is not guaranteed.</strong> We already mentioned it above, but this is worth repeating: with bounties, a lot of the research work has to be done upfront. If you are willing to do that, you better be prepared to cover the research expenses somehow.</p><p><strong>Decision-making can be paralyzing.</strong> Teams where decision-making among stakeholders is broken generally have a much bigger fish to fry. Still, with multiple stakeholders who rarely agree on anything, who will make the decision whether a bounty patch should be accepted?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="communication-issues">Communication issues<a href="#communication-issues" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Communication issues" title="Direct link to Communication issues">​</a></h3><p>Part of the problem is also in <strong>finding the right words</strong>. Even when developers themselves set bounty ideas, they still tend to have a hard time communicating the amount of work it takes to do something and therefore the cost of it. Non-technical users have a very vague idea about the implications of writing new code or even reusing existing code. A very common request is to add a new feature by “just reusing” code written in Python in a program written in C++, because “it’s open source, so you already have everything you need”. This isn’t anyone’s fault, it’s just explaining technical intricacies to people with less or no programming experience takes some time and practice.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-reasons">Technical reasons<a href="#technical-reasons" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technical reasons" title="Direct link to Technical reasons">​</a></h3><p><strong>Bounties typically start from one person's use case</strong> and thus commonly don't take the big picture into account. The idea might work for this one person, but could it be done better? Or is it even an actual problem? The use case might be stupid, because the user is trying to do something in a non-orthogonal way while easier solutions already exist and would work just as well. Or the workaround that is requested in the bounty might have a better implementation as a core feature. And the list goes on.</p><p><strong>Bounties don’t encourage incremental solutions.</strong> The very idea of bounties is that someone does the entire work in one go, as a quick solution, takes the money, and leaves. But when the feature implies digging into the architecture, this basically means two things: either the developer works on a deep fix for a very long time and thus has a hard time rebasing to changes in the upstream branch (think of RealThunder’s LinkStage branch), or they have to submit work in small batches over a long period of time, but that’s not what bounties are generally expected to be.</p><p><strong>Bounties favor outcomes that maximize bounty for minimum effort.</strong> So they don’t encourage elegant, testable code or unit testing. In the end, this bites everyone in the neck — both users and developers.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="if-not-bounties-then-what">If not bounties, then what?<a href="#if-not-bounties-then-what" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to If not bounties, then what?" title="Direct link to If not bounties, then what?">​</a></h2><p>Finally, let’s talk about some of the better approaches at community funding of development. No single way is perfect, but that’s not the point. By trying things that actually work we all can come up with new, better solutions. We are not talking about the “paid support” model here though, plenty has already been said about that over the past few decades.</p><p>One of the very basic ideas here is that — especially in large projects — development ideas in any form should be verified by respective core teams. So it's best when the project has a process of idea verification between multiple stakeholders.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="crowdfunding-and-stretch-goals">Crowdfunding and stretch goals<a href="#crowdfunding-and-stretch-goals" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Crowdfunding and stretch goals" title="Direct link to Crowdfunding and stretch goals">​</a></h3><p>One example of idea verification is what the Krita team does whenever they run a crowdfunding campaign (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/krita/krita-free-paint-app-lets-make-it-faster-than-phot/description" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s been a while though</a>). They collect user requests, sit down, go through each of them, take the ones that make sense, figure out how much time each would take to implement, then take the ones that passed validation as relatively easy fixes/features and group them into stretch goals and set a price to it. That price is already adjusted for the time it took them to do the verification. So far, their estimations have been very close to actual expenses.</p><p>If they would not get sponsoring for stretch goals, the verification expenses would be covered by other sources of income like sales on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/280680/Krita/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> and <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/krita/9N6X57ZGRW96?hl=en-rs&amp;gl=rs&amp;rtc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Store</a>. This means that any team following in their footsteps better have a stable source of income to cover the expenses of the work they do upfront. This works best in teams that organized themselves into a non-commercial organization and have a diversified pool of income sources (think Blender Foundation and, well, FreeCAD now).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="developer-fund">Developer fund<a href="#developer-fund" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Developer fund" title="Direct link to Developer fund">​</a></h3><p>A developer fund can be created and used in multiple ways. It can be very similar to crowdfunding, especially if you look at what the Kdenlive team <a href="https://kdenlive.org/en/fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been doing</a>.</p><p>They chose who would be working on features and decided to hire people who are already active in the project and had the opportunity to devote part of their time to this work without jeopardizing their other obligations.</p><p>Then they came up with a short list of really useful features to implement. They balanced them between roadmap items and things that users requested in their discussion rooms. They also only chose tasks that they knew they would be able to solve based on their team’s expertise.</p><p>Then they estimated the price by decomposing proposed features into smaller tasks and deciding to fund 50% of the time that accomplishing that work would require.</p><p>The campaign was launched with KDE e.V. and their Donorbox-based system. Funds were collected within the first month of the campaign, while it was supposed to run for three months. Some of their 2023 goals outlined on the fund page have already been reached.</p><p>But a fund can also be used to hire full-time developers or issue part-time development grants. Blender Foundation famously <a href="https://fund.blender.org/grants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does both</a>. Blender’s fund is also filled from <a href="https://fund.blender.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple sources</a> — both corporate sponsorships and personal donations, one-time as well as recurring.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="grants">Grants<a href="#grants" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Grants" title="Direct link to Grants">​</a></h3><p>The idea behind a grant is that an organization behind a FOSS project builds a relationship with one or more community members by hiring them to do a specific one-time job: implement a feature, modernize an aging part of the source code, write documentation, design new UI etc.</p><p>We’ve already mentioned Blender Foundation as one of the organizations that issue grants, but there’s obviously more. The Inkscape team has recently hired a full-time senior developer to work on the GTK4 port of the vector graphics editor for several months. And the FreeCAD Project Association is no stranger to grants either: <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fpadf-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two grants</a> were issued last year, to RealThunder (the toponaming fix) and to Ajinkya Dahale (spline handling in Sketcher).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contract-development">Contract development<a href="#contract-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contract development" title="Direct link to Contract development">​</a></h3><p>There’s a certain peace-of-mind element in doing contracted work as compared to working for a bounty. It’s easier to discuss scope, you can charge for the work in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_materials" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time-and-materials</a> fashion etc. You still have to wrangle stakeholders — there’s no way around that (and there likely shouldn’t be), but all your extra expenses will typically be covered by a clause in the contract.</p><p>If you want an example, look no further: the Path workbench in FreeCAD was originally the subject of a contracted job. This project involved a lot of upfront conversation with FreeCAD maintainers about changing the core to allow for rendering toolpaths. The core features were specifically implemented in a way that would allow 3rd-party workbenches and alternative user interfaces to be created for CNC-related use cases.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-paid-binaries-model">The paid binaries model<a href="#the-paid-binaries-model" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The paid binaries model" title="Direct link to The paid binaries model">​</a></h3><p>To some extent, the Ardour project pioneered this approach to funding development: they came up with an idea that users who can’t build Ardour for themselves (it’s more difficult on Windows and macOS) can pay a small monthly fee that is a fraction of what users pay for proprietary digital audio workstations. This alone pays the bills of two full-time developers and some occasionally helpful contributors.</p><p>Two more similar projects, <a href="https://www.zrythm.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zrythm</a> and <a href="https://users.notam02.no/~kjetism/radium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radium</a>, use the same funding model — most likely with less success.

We are doing a very similar thing with Ondsel, except we don’t own FreeCAD but merely contribute to it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-conclusion">In conclusion<a href="#in-conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to In conclusion" title="Direct link to In conclusion">​</a></h2><p>Bounties are a lousy foundation for sustainable development of large projects like FreeCAD. They typically represent a gross underestimation of real work required to solve a problem, commonly miss a bigger picture, and encourage worst software development practices.</p><p>Growing larger is fun but also really overwhelming. Most ambitious projects that aim to stay afloat will have to experiment with different approaches to getting funded on a regular basis and come up with their own mix of solutions. It’s that or perish.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the sorely missing features in FreeCAD is a convenient system for creating custom properties and interacting with them.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the sorely missing features in FreeCAD is a convenient system for creating custom data elements and interacting with them.</p><p>A common use case is constraining multiple features in a sketch to the same value. Instead of tweaking every instance of a horizontal distance constraint, you would create a custom data element (or property) called “Length” and then reference it via the Expression Engine. Then every time you change the value of that custom element, the entire sketch is updated automatically.</p><p>This is an extremely handy feature, so there is a strong community demand for this. Most recently, it was brought up twice during the <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=75768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Complaint Session"</a> at FOSDEM. And even a quick glance at the larger CAD market suggests that it’s useful for more than just a group of FreeCAD users: Inventor, SolidWorks, NX, Creo all have a way to create a custom data element and use it with expressions.</p><p>Much like with <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assemblies</a>, the community made several attempts to create a solution, but all of them have various shortcomings which we’ll discuss below.</p><p>Fixing this benefits the entire FreeCAD ecosystem. Users would get a convenient tool for manipulating their designs, it would be immediately available and maintained as an inherent part of the project. For companies like Ondsel who want to build around FreeCAD, this system is the prerequisite for integrating it into external services.</p><p>A large part of this system is therefore parameters introspection. This is a complicated topic that probably deserves a separate discussion. But the basic idea is this. When you design a real-life part, some of the custom data elements you create are convenience tools like in the use case above. They contribute to making the design truly parametric yet do not need to be accessed and manipulated externally. But when FreeCAD is used in headless mode in a pipeline, whatever external tools you rely on better be able to tell which properties they need to expose to the user (dimensions, color, material etc.) and which ones have to be omitted. Essentially, custom parameters need to carry some useful context.</p><p>So let’s talk about existing options, where they shine and fail, and what we think a sensible solution would look like based on what we learned.</p><p>In this post, we are also introducing another new author. Ajinkya Dahale has been a FreeCAD contributor since 2016. His contributions are mostly in the Sketcher, PartDesign, and FEM workbenches. Ajinkya’s latest major involvement, improving B-spline <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=71130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">constraints</a> and <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=75950" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">construction</a>, was sponsored by the FreeCAD community both directly and <a href="https://blog.freecad.org/2022/09/26/first-fpa-sponsored-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via the FreeCAD Project Association</a>. He also received a <a href="https://opentoolchain.org/2023/02/26/FOSDEM-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grant from the Open Toolchain Foundation</a>. Since early 2023, he has been working for Ondsel and continues hacking on FreeCAD.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="elements-or-properties">Elements or Properties?<a href="#elements-or-properties" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Elements or Properties?" title="Direct link to Elements or Properties?">​</a></h2><p>Before we get to the gist of the topic, we need to explain why we use the terminology “custom data elements” and not “custom properties” when we talk about the future system. Calling this type of data a property implies a particular solution — storing this data in the project tree and making it accessible for editing in the Combo View dock. But we are not yet certain this is exactly the way to do this. For now, we are using the term “custom data elements”.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="benchmark">Benchmark<a href="#benchmark" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Benchmark" title="Direct link to Benchmark">​</a></h2><p>To understand how well various existing solutions work, we need a kind of a benchmark — a realistic workflow that allows working with custom data elements efficiently. We can describe it with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user story</a>:</p><ol><li>The user begins to set the constraint and realizes they would like to make the value a custom field. The constraint panel would have a button to add a custom field.</li><li>The button would allow the user to add a new item to a collection of custom data elements.</li><li>The result would be returned and inserted via the Expression Engine.</li></ol><p>This workflow obviously applies to the Sketcher workbench, but there are many more use cases for custom data elements. You could be using them when designing a house, a 3D-printable part, or a part for CNC milling, or a thousand more things. So this better be a core feature.
There are multiple possible approaches to exposing custom data elements to users in the UI — pressing a shortcut to activate a floating window, editing an object in the document tree, or editing a value in a new tab in the property viewer. But for now, let’s call this a benchmark and see how existing solutions stack up against it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="existing-solutions">Existing solutions<a href="#existing-solutions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Existing solutions" title="Direct link to Existing solutions">​</a></h2><p>We found 4 attempts to implement this feature.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-spreadsheet-workbench">The Spreadsheet workbench<a href="#the-spreadsheet-workbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Spreadsheet workbench" title="Direct link to The Spreadsheet workbench">​</a></h3><p>This WB was designed for many uses, so it’s not entirely fair to call it a custom data elements system. The workbench has two major benefits: it’s both powerful (e.g. cells in the spreadsheet can contain expressions) and it’s already part of FreeCAD, available immediately after program’s installation.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The Spreadsheet workbench in FreeCAD" src="/assets/images/spreadsheet-wb-in-freecad-3b7d1d264cd5b4fd6c87e83319c2df71.png" width="753" height="571" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The way spreadsheets work in FreeCAD, this is the assumed workflow:</p><ol><li>The user exits Sketcher</li><li>Switches to the Spreadsheet workbench</li><li>Creates a spreadsheet</li><li>Double-clicks the spreadsheet in the tree</li><li>Selects a cell and enters a value</li><li>Selects the cell a second time</li><li>Clicks the button to set an alias</li><li>Types in the alias name and presses OK</li><li>Double-clicks the sketch icon in the tree to reopen Sketcher</li><li>Selects the constraint and uses the Expression Engine to reference the aliased cell</li></ol><p>Compared to the benchmark above, this isn’t very user-friendly. FreeCAD contributors attempted to make their life easier by <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Macro_EasyAlias" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simplifying alias creation</a>, but that fixes only a small portion of issues with spreadsheets. While we definitely can improve its subpar performance and UX/UI, tables are still not very convenient for extracting values without launching FreeCAD and using its GUI.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="property-bag-in-path">Property Bag in Path<a href="#property-bag-in-path" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Property Bag in Path" title="Direct link to Property Bag in Path">​</a></h3><p>This feature is part of the default FreeCAD’s Path workbench. You can create groups of properties, which is convenient when you have a lot of those, and there is a sensible choice of property types available.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Groups of properties in Property Bag" src="/assets/images/propertybag-groups-of-properties-206907fbd34728d83da07c360ceecfe5.png" width="832" height="676" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>But while custom properties in the “bag” are perfectly accessible from other workbenches via the Expression Engine, you can only create and modify properties when you are in the Path workbench. So it’s not competitive against the benchmark. This feature is also written in Python, so it’s entirely possible it would have to be ripped out of Path and rewritten in C++.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Editing properties in Property Bag" src="/assets/images/property-bag-editing-properties-46df2f5d64594309adf6c9db5f91e280.png" width="832" height="676" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-dynamicdata-workbench">The DynamicData workbench<a href="#the-dynamicdata-workbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The DynamicData workbench" title="Direct link to The DynamicData workbench">​</a></h3><p>This is a <a href="https://github.com/mwganson/DynamicData" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3rd party add-on</a> that allows creating project-level custom properties accessible through the Expression Engine from any workbench. You can create any number of containers of properties, one per each object if you like. There is a very long list of property types available.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The DynamicData workbench in FreeCAD" src="/assets/images/dynamic-data-ui-6803e93f6ef98291a70b54086d310aac.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Workflow-wise, this is not a very convenient solution. There are some cosmetic UX issues (e.g. you have to switch to this workbench first for the toolbar to show in other workbenches), but we can deal with those. What’s worse is that properties can’t be added on the fly, while you are sketching in 2D.</p><p>Theoretically, DynamicData could work as a foundation for a better solution. However:</p><ul><li>The WB is written in Python, but FreeCAD needs this as a core feature, hence it should most likely be C++ code.</li><li>The entire feature set is only accessible via GUI, which is not great for running FreeCAD in headless mode.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="userdata-in-assembly-4">UserData in Assembly 4<a href="#userdata-in-assembly-4" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to UserData in Assembly 4" title="Direct link to UserData in Assembly 4">​</a></h3><p>The variables system in the Assembly 4 workbench is designed primarily for creating animations in the viewport. Here is how it works:</p><ol><li>Create a variable like “rotation”</li><li>Pick a part, set its rotation value to use the variable via the Expression Engine</li><li>Open the animation dialog, set start/end values, set step size</li><li>Run the animation</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="UserData in Assembly 4" src="/assets/images/assembly4-user-data-469f7d9f9e45e9799dea9f4c6574f684.png" width="1065" height="609" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The core system behind this feature is capable. The list of possible data types can (and should) be extended, but it’s good for a start. There are some small issues. E.g. there’s no way to edit an existing variable, the user can only create and delete them.</p><p>A much larger issue is that the feature is workbench-specific and written in Python. Thus, it would have to be extracted from the Assembly 4 code and most likely rewritten in C++. Then we’d have to write an entirely new UI on top of it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h3><p>Reusing any of the existing solutions we explored seems unlikely for the following reasons:</p><ol><li><p>For the most part, they are not part of the FreeCAD core. The DynamicData and Assembly 4 workbenches need to be installed separately, and in case of Property Bag, the functionality needs to be moved out of the Path workbench and generalized.</p></li><li><p>None of the 4 solutions here are accessible from C++ code, so no core feature can use custom data elements. So far, this hasn't really been an issue, but it’s best to build future-proof core features.</p></li><li><p>For the Python interface, there should be some sort of keyword-based system to set these values to these custom data elements. This way users can skip certain parameters like description.</p></li><li><p>Custom data elements in existing solutions carry no context. This makes it difficult for an external tool to sift through available parameters and pick the ones that should be exposed to users in the UI of that external tool. This can be resolved by making the user create a specific kind of document object or name it a certain way, but it would put an unnecessary cognitive burden on users.</p></li><li><p>The Spreadsheet workbench is the only core feature among the ones we studied. Spreadsheet serves and important role and isn’t going anywhere.  However its UX is so far from the assumed workflow and so inaccessible from CLI that we shouldn’t try to force it to serve this purpose.  In fact, Spreadsheet may be come even more useful in conjunction with a core data element feature.</p></li></ol><p>In a nutshell, there’s no existing solution that can be used as-is.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-the-solution-should-look-like">What The Solution Should Look Like<a href="#what-the-solution-should-look-like" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What The Solution Should Look Like" title="Direct link to What The Solution Should Look Like">​</a></h2><p>After analyzing existing solutions (including those of proprietary CAD programs), some obvious use cases, as well as user requests, we came up with the following list of requirements for a native custom data elements system in FreeCAD.</p><p>Architecturally, there should be a single container with a possibility to create groups of data elements inside it.
Secondly, there’s the topic of element types. The system should support all core data types: Length, Angle, Enum, String etc.</p><p>When we start thinking about this from users’ standpoint, this is where things get a little vague. There are benefits to having elements as properties in the project tree, but a kind of a dedicated registry or central management tool  (SolidWorks-style) makes about as much sense. What we are certain of is that:</p><ul><li>Adding new data elements from Sketcher and other WBs should be simple and obvious.</li><li>Tooltips for data elements should be possible so that collaborators could figure out your project easily.</li><li>Expression Engine should be supported.</li></ul><p>When we talk about adding data elements easily, what we mean is that users should be able to create those from anywhere in the application and in the middle of a transaction like editing a sketch. Think of the way you can create named parameters in Inventor by just typing “Length=530mm” in the constraint input box to create a linked “Length” property and setting it to 530mm.</p><p>Moreover, users should be able to create and access custom data elements through CLI so that models could be adjusted when FreeCAD is running remotely, and possibly automated as macros. Example: load a gridfinity template, set the number of height units, choose a color, output an STL, send it to OctoPrint.</p><p>Finally, on a more technical note, users should be able to create and access custom data elements from code in either C++ or Python. That is, the feature should be accessible for core features, default workbenches, and 3rd party workbenches. This can be ensured by creating the framework in C++ and adding Python bindings.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-proposal">Our Proposal<a href="#our-proposal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our Proposal" title="Direct link to Our Proposal">​</a></h2><p>We see this as a multi-stage project with work on expanding the FreeCAD file format accordingly, programming a C++ class and Python bindings, as well as designing and implementing the user interface. We have already settled on the document structure for our proposal — a single container with custom data elements, just like we mentioned above.
3rd-party developers would be able to use C++ or Python to access custom data elements: get a list of them, create a new data element, or get an existing one and then set a value to it. This is how we picture the custom data elements can be accessed through Python:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">my_doc = App.ActiveDocument()</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">my_doc.CustomData # The container for Custom Data elements</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">my_doc.CustomData.setProperty(“App::PropertyFloat”, name=”myDim”, 1.23) # Setting a double</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">my_doc.CustomData.getProperty(“myDim”) # Getting the value of the property</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">my_doc.CustomData.setProperty(“App::PropertyString”, “myText”, “hello”, desc=”Text to be printed on name plate”) # Setting a string with description</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">my_doc.CustomData.setProperty(“App::PropertyEnum”, “myEnum”, value=0, enum_values=[“Option1”, “Option2”, “Option3”]) # Setting an enum along with the values it can take.

We think that users who rely on external tools for interacting with FreeCAD projects should be able to make a choice which custom data elements should be seen as private and which should be seen as public. This distinction is somewhat artificial, because everything is open in FreeCAD files. But it provides a simple way for external tools to expose only a subset of custom data elements — the ones that are supposed to be interacted with in UI. This is what we want Ondsel’s cloud service to do when it comes to mass customization of designs.</p><p>We are still figuring out the interaction model and the UI. The quick and dirty solution is to add those to a new tab called “Custom” right next to “View” and “Data” in the left dock. This can work as a simple temporary solution, but we think the View/Data separation is a superficial one and needs to be done away with (a story for another day). When a user uploads a document to our web view and sets only one dimension of the project to ‘public’ (e.g. only the length of a box but not its width or height), we expect that other users viewing this document would get to control only that dimension.</p><p>Here is an early UI wireframe:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Early UI wireframe for custom data elements" src="/assets/images/preliminary-ui-wireframe-00cd20ff132cec30b2fbe28fa7df223b.png" width="1660" height="784" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>There are other approaches to designing the interaction, like what Inventor and Fusion 360 do with the properties table.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-you-can-get-involved">How You Can Get Involved<a href="#how-you-can-get-involved" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How You Can Get Involved" title="Direct link to How You Can Get Involved">​</a></h2><p>We are interested in general feedback about our proposal, but we are also specifically looking for your input on these two topics:</p><ul><li>What are your use cases for custom data elements? What kind of problems do you try to solve with those?</li><li>What are your frustrations with both existing solutions in FreeCAD and other CAD programs?</li></ul><p>This would help us build a sensible interaction model and user interface for custom data elements in FreeCAD.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FreeCAD has a basic implementation of a materials system. While it works in some scenarios, we think it can be vastly improved to become a lot more useful. Let’s discuss what’s already available, what’s missing, and what’s a possible way forward with this. But first, why are we even discussing it?</p><p>We are introducing a new co-author in this post. Dave Carter has been a FreeCAD user since v0.16 (primarily for rocketry and 3D printing). He worked over 40 years as a software developer in government, supply chain, and automotive industries. He is the main person behind the <a href="https://github.com/davesrocketshop/Rocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rocket</a> workbench that helps design model and amateur rockets and components for them. Dave volunteered to lead the effort creating an updated materials system for FreeCAD and has been actively working towards that goal for the past several weeks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-a-good-materials-system-is-important">Why A Good Materials System Is Important<a href="#why-a-good-materials-system-is-important" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why A Good Materials System Is Important" title="Direct link to Why A Good Materials System Is Important">​</a></h2><p>Materials are a lot more than the color of solids in the viewport. As engineers, we need basic mechanical properties like density to calculate mass. We need advanced mechanical properties, as well as thermal and electrical properties to run various simulations (think finite element analysis). We need vendor-specific data to make an estimation of material cost. We also need materials to make commercial-grade rendering easy.</p><p>So a good materials system needs a database of materials with mechanical, thermal, electrical, architectural, and other properties. But it goes even further than that.</p><p>We know that materials behave differently depending on environment conditions. For example, we know that Young's modulus of metals decreases when temperature increases. So a materials system has to provide tools to build relationships between different material properties. Otherwise simulations won’t provide usable results.</p><p>Is that all? Nope. A concrete wall will have a first coat and then a finish. A model rocket will have a primer paint on top of the body, and then a coat of spray paint on top of parts of the primer paint. So a good materials system has to be able to deal with compound materials / multi-materials.</p><p>It’s also a great idea to have a more or less uniform UX/UI for working with materials in different scenarios. An architect by trade can be a tinkerer in their spare time, making Arduino-based devices, small home automation projects, and the like. They would appreciate not having to re-learn everything just because it’s a different set of tools in the same CAD system they use.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-whats-wrong-with-what-we-already-have">So What’s Wrong With What We Already Have?<a href="#so-whats-wrong-with-what-we-already-have" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So What’s Wrong With What We Already Have?" title="Direct link to So What’s Wrong With What We Already Have?">​</a></h2><p>Let’s take a closer look at what’s currently available in FreeCAD. A major part of the existing materials system is the Material Editor:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Existing materials editor" src="/assets/images/current-materials-editor-ef0301422381273b27ee5989224849cc.png" width="1308" height="1135" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It relies on a small catalog of materials (slightly over 100) available throughout FreeCAD. For each material, it’s possible to set properties in several categories:</p><ul><li>Mechanical</li><li>Thermal</li><li>Electrical</li><li>Architectural</li><li>Rendering</li><li>Vector Rendering (hatching)</li><li>Cost (vendor-specific)</li><li>User-defined</li></ul><p>Custom properties can be added to the user-defined category to accommodate for workflow specifics.</p><p>The existing materials system is currently used in FEM and Arch workbenches that are available by default, as well as in 3rd-party workbenches like <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Rocket_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rocket</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-render" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Render</a>.</p><p>All this is a great start. But there are also various issues. Here are just some of the more obvious ones:</p><ul><li>It is impossible to set a different material to every face of a part. You can have a piece of metal or block of concrete with a coating on one side and nothing at all on the other one.</li><li>Multi-materials are only possible in the Arch workbench, but that is not enough. Any metallic or plastic solid and a paint job already make it <em>at least</em> two materials.</li><li>It should be possible to override properties set in the material card in a more or less uniform way. Maybe a variation of a material has slightly different mechanical or thermal properties, or maybe a building materials supplier is setting a different cost on a per-project basis.</li><li>Material cards do not account for real-life behavior of materials, e.g. some physical properties may vary with temperature. A common use case is <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=461640&amp;sid=cb795e11170e14ba824af3b437645500#p461640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">describing different CTEs at different temperatures for FEM</a>. Moreover, the existing system only allows for isotropic materials that behave consistently regardless of direction. Orthotropic materials, such as wood, have different characteristics depending on direction: against the grain is stronger than with the grain.</li><li>Texture mapping is separate from the material settings and only allows loading a texture file, with no positioning settings.</li><li>Material information is not accounted for when importing/exporting from/to some file formats.</li><li>There are no built-in functions to use the material data to make basic calculations such as weight, or cost.</li><li>There’s no easy way to tell which part of an assembly doesn’t have an assigned material.</li><li>The material editor has no UI for categories. It works as long as the list of materials is relatively small, but this will become a problem once the list is expanded.</li></ul><p>This is just scratching the surface.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="previous-attempt-at-fixing-the-materials-system">Previous Attempt at Fixing The Materials System<a href="#previous-attempt-at-fixing-the-materials-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Previous Attempt at Fixing The Materials System" title="Direct link to Previous Attempt at Fixing The Materials System">​</a></h2><p>The topic of improving the existing materials system has been brought up before. Around 2016, a contributor named Eivind Kvedalen attempted to fix some of the issues, in particular: arbitrary properties, per-face materials, infrastructure for a material database. He made two commits in a public fork on GitHub, and continued the discussion. But eventually this initiative went into slumber. Right now, the fork needs further work to even compile.</p><p>As is usual in the FreeCAD ecosystem, people also attempted to come up with various workarounds. The 3rd-party <a href="https://github.com/furti/FreeCAD-ArchTextures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arch Textures</a> workbench exists solely to work around the limitations of the built-in texture mapper. The <a href="https://github.com/andreasBihlmaier/FreeCAD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FCinfo</a> macro helps make basic calculations based on mechanical properties.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-the-updated-materials-system-should-be-like">What The Updated Materials System Should Be Like<a href="#what-the-updated-materials-system-should-be-like" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What The Updated Materials System Should Be Like" title="Direct link to What The Updated Materials System Should Be Like">​</a></h2><p>Having studied the subject, here’s the gist of what we think the new system should be like.</p><p>FreeCAD needs a <strong>way to store materials data</strong> in the project. If you created an assembly and used materials with custom properties (even if it’s just the material cost because you got a discount from your supplier), your team or contractors should be able to open that file and see assigned materials and related data.</p><p>There have to be <strong>per-face / per-solid materials and multi-materials</strong>. This shouldn’t be an Arch-specific feature like it is now, it has to be available for all workbenches.</p><p>There needs to be a <strong>more uniform UX/UI for selecting material and overriding its properties</strong> one way or another. The set of properties may vary between workbenches, but UI for overriding should follow the same design pattern.</p><p>It would be an absolute must to have an easily<strong> accessible calculation of basic part properties</strong>. Users should be able to easily see the weight of one part or an entire assembly.</p><p>We definitely see interest in having <strong>texture mapping and probably hatching</strong> as part of a material, with advanced settings. Advanced UV editing could be done by 3rd-party tools, but the basics of texture mapping should be there.</p><p>The <strong>material editor has to be enhanced</strong>: materials should be pre-organized into categories, have tags, rendering preview etc. The list of materials should be searchable.</p><p>There’s a strong requirement to be able to <strong>set relationships between properties for realistic simulations</strong>. There are multiple approaches to do that. We can do it with curves (like SolidWorks does) or by making multiple entries with an associated temperature range (or pressure, or whatever).</p><p>It’s generally a good idea to have <strong>easy access to up-to-date vendor data on materials</strong> where possible. There are many existing materials systems, <a href="https://github.com/Moult/IfcClassification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> are just some of those in the architecture department. We know that accessing up-to-date information won’t be easy. When APIs even exist, they are typically not public or documented. And even there we’d be extremely cautious, because setting cost implies responsibility, and FreeCAD needs to be very clear where that responsibility is.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-way-forward">The Way Forward<a href="#the-way-forward" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Way Forward" title="Direct link to The Way Forward">​</a></h2><p>Because of how far-reaching the implications of the materials system are, we think bringing it to the state of the art needs to be a community project with all major stakeholders involved.</p><p>There’s a small task force building around this project.</p><p>Ondsel made a start on analyzing what makes a materials system great, explored implementations in various other CAD programs (SolidWorks, Inventor, Onshape, Revit, Archicad), studied the existing implementation in FreeCAD, and put together an initial list of requirements.</p><p>Dave Carter, the developer behind the Rocket workbench, volunteered to lead the effort and already <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=4&amp;p=685834#p685834" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made good progress</a> towards designing a better material editor and replacing the old material cards storage system with human-readable YAML files.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="New materials editor" src="/assets/images/new-materials-editor-alpha-380ee9be228aa714739f575845c94782.png" width="852" height="747" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The first stage of this project is just that: new materials editor UI, new file format for material cards, and over 600 categorized materials. It’s a work in progress, you can see the updated material card UI on the screenshot above. </p><p>The second stage will involve physical properties, relationships between those, and appearance settings.</p><p>After that, work has to be done on finalizing the UI, polishing icons, writing documentation etc.</p><p>There are also a number of considerations to be made, depending on feedback from users and developers. More on that below.</p><p>Once we collect more information, we will analyze it and submit a public proposal in FreeCAD’s issue tracker for everyone to see and comment on. We’ll then do our best to help all interested parties to complete this project. We discussed it with the FPA, and a grant is possible.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-ondsels-interest-in-a-materials-system">What’s Ondsel’s Interest In A Materials System<a href="#whats-ondsels-interest-in-a-materials-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s Ondsel’s Interest In A Materials System" title="Direct link to What’s Ondsel’s Interest In A Materials System">​</a></h2><p>There are multiple reasons for Ondsel to be involved with (and lead) this initiative.</p><p>Ondsel’s platform is primarily FreeCAD users, so the better FreeCAD is, the more users it has, the more customers the company gets (and thus the more Ondsel can invest into improving FreeCAD further). So the company needs FreeCAD to be excellent in every aspect. A great materials system is part of that.</p><p>Ondsel is also considering implementation of some features like commercial-grade ray-tracing in the online service that will directly depend on a materials system.</p><p>Thus the company is interested in working with anyone willing to implement a better materials system and support them as much as we can. Dave made an impressive start on revamping the entire system, but he will need help.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-you-can-do">What You Can Do<a href="#what-you-can-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What You Can Do" title="Direct link to What You Can Do">​</a></h2><p>There definitely are ways you can be part of this initiative.</p><p>If you are a user, we are interested to know more about your workflow specifics:</p><ul><li>How do you use materials in FreeCAD or elsewhere?</li><li>What materials-dependent simulations do you run? What material properties do they rely on?</li><li>What type of materials do you deal with on a daily basis? What’s their variety? How often do you add custom materials?</li><li>Are there specific material vendors you deal with? Do they make it easy to access materials data?</li><li>Do you use the Appearance dialog to change the look of parts? How would replacing it with something actually based on materials’ appearance settings affect your workflow? </li><li>What file formats do you import/export that require materials support?</li><li>What are your appearance/texturing requirements for materials?</li><li>What are your sources of material physical properties?</li><li>Would you be more comfortable with a purely offline materials database, an online materials database like <a href="https://materialsproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Materials Project</a>, or a combination of both?</li></ul><p>If you are a workbench/macro developer, what specific requirements for a materials system does the materials team need to know about? If you are a developer with experience programming materials’ look and feel, please contact Dave.</p><p>We’d love to have you join the <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=4&amp;t=78242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussion</a>. If you agree that better materials will help make FreeCAD great and don't have any feedback to offer, please consider <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Donate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">donating to the FPA</a> so that more contributors get support for improving FreeCAD.</p><p>And last but not least, Dave Carter’s initiative to take matters into his own hands is precisely the kind of practical approach to improving FreeCAD that we’d love to see more of. If you are a user who shares this view, please consider donating to FreeCAD Project Association’s <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fpadf-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer fund</a>, so that active contributors getting funding would become the norm.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Discussions about FOSS issue practices often center around getting issue creation right. Have we set contributors up for success with guidelines and issue templates? Are we asking them to look at existing issues for their proposal first? These are bare minimum requirements. </p><p>We act like someone creates an issue and throws it over the wall, after which someone else picks it up to move it forward—all of which hinges on writing a good issue. If the issue goes stale, it wasn't a good issue, right?</p><p>But issue creation should be <em>the start of a conversation</em>, and for that, maintainers should be heavily involved in collaborating on issues. <a href="http://danluu.com/discourage-oss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stale PRs</a> get a lot of airtime, but issues habitually going stale is just as bad for open source project velocity. Effective issues—the ones that actually result in meaningful change—invite conversation and encourage action, and maintainers can play more of a role in fostering that type of issue than you might think.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-makes-a-good-issue">What makes a good issue?<a href="#what-makes-a-good-issue" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What makes a good issue?" title="Direct link to What makes a good issue?">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD's contributing document</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#6-process" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">process for contributions</a> serve a number of <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#1-goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goals</a>, such as providing transparency and fairness, and enabling faster inclusion of contributions while preserving code quality. We can extrapolate a lot about what makes a good vs bad issue from the <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#5-contribution-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contribution Requirements</a>. </p><table><thead><tr><th>What is a "bad" issue?</th><th>What makes a "good" issue?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Raises a suite of problems</td><td>Focuses on one problem to solve</td></tr><tr><td>Focuses on the desired feature or functionality, what it looks like, how it behaves, what options it offers</td><td>Describes the user's goal and what is standing in the way</td></tr><tr><td>Tells the developer what to do</td><td>Tells the developer about the problem the submitter is trying to solve (including current workarounds that help devs to understand user intent)</td></tr><tr><td>Requires maintainers to visit external links and read other material to gain context</td><td>Is complete and self contained</td></tr><tr><td>Proposes something that's out of scope for the project/doesn't seem to fit with roadmap</td><td>Fits naturally into project roadmap and can be justified by it</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Well defined issues are like <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nerd Sniping</a>. They're hard to ignore and inspire creative problem solving. We can expect issue authors to at least familiarize themselves with a project's contribution guidelines and issue templates and make an effort to provide a complete issue. If an issue isn't getting continuous attention though, that's a sign that the issue needs improvement.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-role-of-maintainers">The role of maintainers<a href="#the-role-of-maintainers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The role of maintainers" title="Direct link to The role of maintainers">​</a></h2><p>Beyond the usual <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/contribution-barriers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expectations of maintainers</a> (engage kindly with contributors, respond in a timely manner, give regular updates), we can think about maintainers' responsibilities in two stages:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="before-an-issue-is-created">Before an issue is created<a href="#before-an-issue-is-created" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Before an issue is created" title="Direct link to Before an issue is created">​</a></h3><p>The discourse around open source project issues tends to focus on this stage, and the common advice is to provide adequate guidelines and issue templates to help contributors create issues that meet requirements. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="after-an-issue-is-created">After an issue is created<a href="#after-an-issue-is-created" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to After an issue is created" title="Direct link to After an issue is created">​</a></h3><p>Beyond contribution guidelines, maintainers should use automations to streamline the contribution process and encourage momentum. <a href="https://github.com/raycastbot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raycastbot</a> automatically @ mentions contributors who have worked on that specific Raycast extension in the past:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="raycastimage" src="/assets/images/image1-60532b1087a5ff053c97730a3db79e08.png" width="1944" height="496" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>VS Code has a host of <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-github-triage-actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Issue Triage GitHub Actions</a> that perform housekeeping tasks like <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-github-triage-actions#stale-closer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closing stale issues</a> or <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-github-triage-actions#english-please" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">requesting a translation of issues not written in English</a>.</p><p>These practices can relieve some of the burden on maintainers so they have more time to dedicate to the more impactful, vital part of a maintainer's role in issue management:</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="proactive-involvement-and-collaboration-on-issues">Proactive involvement and collaboration on issues<a href="#proactive-involvement-and-collaboration-on-issues" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Proactive involvement and collaboration on issues" title="Direct link to Proactive involvement and collaboration on issues">​</a></h4><p>Even with the above practices in place, sometimes even a well defined issue goes stale. It might represent an extreme edge case or an inconvenience that users have found ways to work around. These issues often get overlooked because they aren’t seen as part of a bigger initiative. Maintainers can help by tagging these issues appropriately and adding them to projects where they form part of a bigger context. </p><p>For example, an issue describing a minor UI tweak might be widely regarded as a good idea and still might be ignored because it’s always judged as less important than something else. But if the same issue is put into a project for general UI improvements, then its relevance and potential impact is more pronounced.</p><p>This is one example of how maintainers can help by making a conscious effort to review and revise issues. Holding regular meetings to walk through and refactor issues can turn non-starter issues into active and actionable discussions, just by:</p><ul><li>Improving the titles to make them more clearly describe the problem to be solved</li><li>Proposing solutions and workarounds</li><li>Requesting clarification from the submitter</li><li>Writing user stories</li><li>Narrowing the scope or splitting the issue into multiple, more manageable ones</li><li>Merging duplicates</li><li>Tagging and labeling</li><li>@ mentioning the right people to get conversation going</li><li>Closing issues that are out of scope or stale</li></ul><p>Some of these actions can be automated as described above, but meeting regularly to review open issues lets you catch ones that have slipped through the cracks.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thinking-beyond-bugs-and-problems-to-solve">Thinking beyond bugs and problems to solve<a href="#thinking-beyond-bugs-and-problems-to-solve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Thinking beyond bugs and problems to solve" title="Direct link to Thinking beyond bugs and problems to solve">​</a></h3><p>For maximum effect, the scope of issues should extend beyond new features and problems to solve, to housekeeping and project maintenance.</p><p>FreeCAD's issue requirements may be thorough, but there are other aspects of the project that aren't managed as well. For example, the project's backporting requests are currently managed in a <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=69437&amp;start=70" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum thread</a>, which isn't great for organization or visibility. </p><p>If backporting was managed via issues grouped into a project, we'd have better visibility into progress and the status of the release as well as the ability to build release notes easily.</p><p>Giving greater status and attention to issues as a primary vehicle through which discussion happens and progress is made also has the effect of bringing forward discussions and debates about value judgments. When these discussions happen early in the cycle, rather than at the PR stage, you're more likely to get changes and new developments that align with your roadmap and move your project forward.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-you-can-help">How you can help<a href="#how-you-can-help" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How you can help" title="Direct link to How you can help">​</a></h2><p>You don't have to be a maintainer to be part of the solution. <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD</a> is experimenting with GitHub projects and could use a lot of help with organizing the issues in line with <a href="#proactive-involvement-and-collaboration-on-issues">the improvements outlined above</a>.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There's a problem with running development FreeCAD builds for actual work and it's going to get uglier soon. Here's the deal.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-wrong-with-the-dev-builds">What's Wrong With The Dev Builds?<a href="#whats-wrong-with-the-dev-builds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's Wrong With The Dev Builds?" title="Direct link to What's Wrong With The Dev Builds?">​</a></h2><p>What users want from FreeCAD is a stable, reliable platform that is trustworthy for doing their work. What they also want are various new features and quality-of-life improvements.</p><p>But FreeCAD has a relatively long and unpredictable release cycle — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCAD#Release_history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">typically over a year</a> between major releases, and no one can put a date on a release in advance. This irregular release schedule has historical reasons (“it’s ready when it’s ready”), but also because over the last several years, contributors did a tremendous amount of work that wasn’t split into smaller chunks. And thus there were large gaps between releases when the team ported FreeCAD from Python2 to Python 3, and then from Qt4 to Qt5.</p><p>With the current effort to resolve topological naming, FreeCAD development is moving toward a more incremental approach. Large changes are merged incrementally rather than waiting until the whole thing is done. This should accelerate the pace of development and reduce the time between releases. It also implies that the development branch will experience more instability than it has in the past.
There’s an obvious conflict between the need for stability and the desire for new features. You can get an increasingly reliable platform by sticking with point releases. Or you can get the latest and greatest by using development builds at the risk of experiencing more glitches or even losing your work due to a crash.</p><p>We encourage everyone doing “real work” to use a stable build and avoid the risk, but for people who accept the risk and run dev builds, things are likely to get even worse soon. Once the project releases version 0.21, the next batch of topo-naming issue fixes will start landing to the main development branch. Because of what these fixes do, FreeCAD is expected to <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/8432#issuecomment-1452672655" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">take a performance hit</a> until optimizations follow at a later stage of development.  Bottom line: the development build is going to get slower for a while.</p><p>In our opinion, this is the perfect time for FreeCAD, as a project, to revisit its release policy.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="time-based-schedule">Time-Based Schedule<a href="#time-based-schedule" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Time-Based Schedule" title="Direct link to Time-Based Schedule">​</a></h2><p>The first part of our proposal is for the FreeCAD project to have more frequent and predictable releases. Effectively — a time-based release schedule. This is common for projects with some kind of financial backing for the core team of developers, like <a href="https://code.blender.org/2021/10/blender-3-x-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blender</a>. But it also works for large projects that receive little-to-no funding on a regular basis, like <a href="https://kdenlive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kdenlive</a> (3 releases a year, following the KDE’s release cycle) and <a href="https://www.darktable.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">darktable</a> (2 releases a year since 2020).</p><p>How often should FreeCAD be released? So far, the project has been struggling to do annual releases on time. So shooting for 2 releases a year and working from there seems like a good initial goal. There are existing release policies like <a href="https://www.openstack.org/software/roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the one at OpenStack</a> that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316357251_Release_Early_Release_Often_and_Release_on_Time_An_Empirical_Case_Study_of_Release_Management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have been studied</a> and could be learned from.</p><p>Let's say we all agree on bi-annual releases. What does it really mean?</p><p><strong>We remove the element of uncertainty for users and developers alike.</strong> Users can plan their upgrades and only use a dev build when they need to test a fix. Contributors can plan ahead and don't need to jeopardize their non-FreeCAD commitments.</p><p><strong>Much shorter development cycle.</strong> This means more focused releases and less urge to include incomplete work, because the next window for merging will open very soon. This also means a much less exhausting period of work for testers and translators.</p><p>Especially in the latter case, contributors are typically expected to either follow development closely and update translations all the time or work like madmen during the strings freeze period because there's just so much work to do. Volunteered work should really be more manageable.</p><p><strong>More frequent point releases.</strong> Once the release schedule is set, users will start counting on point releases happening regularly too (see below on another reason for that).</p><p><strong>More focus on building infrastructure and automation.</strong> A time-based release schedule is going to require a more rigorous release process and a higher level of automation. Only a very small part of the C++ code is covered by unit tests at the moment, this really needs to change. And there is always, <em>always</em> more work to be done on Conda builds. All that means more DevOps work.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="feature-backports">Feature Backports<a href="#feature-backports" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Feature Backports" title="Direct link to Feature Backports">​</a></h2><p>The FreeCAD team already backports bug fixes and security patches from the master branch to the release branch. But we could be doing more. We could be backporting some features and improvements to point releases too. Projects like <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2019/01/02/gimp-and-gegl-in-2018/#version-210-release-and-point-releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIMP</a> and Scribus have been doing this for years now because they have release cycles even longer than those of FreeCAD. For them, it helps keeping users engaged, but it still means that larger, much desired changes take a very long time to show up in a stable release, and that’s the part we would rather avoid.</p><p>This wouldn't render major releases pointless (pun intended). We are thinking primarily of changes that are typically safe and not too time-consuming to backport. If a new feature, however small, comes with an architectural change (API change, file format change etc.), it’s a no-go. But quick UX fixes and other quality-of-life improvements are often possible.</p><p>One way to simplify the process of making this decision is to add a checkbox to the pull request template: “Backportable patch”. The maintainer who does the merge then would see that the PR is supposed to be backportable, check the patch against the backporting criteria, and attempt to cherry-pick the commit(s). Naturally, this implies that the developer who submitted a patch explored how far their change goes and understands whether the fix or the feature can easily be ported to the release branch.</p><p>The net outcome is that users would have even less reasons to keep using development builds and risk their work.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What's Next<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's Next" title="Direct link to What's Next">​</a></h2><p>So what are the actionable things for contributors to do?
First of all, we need to make the release process more regular.  Documenting the major and point release processes in the Developer Handbook should be a priority.  The current 0.20.3 and 0.21 releases are an excellent opportunity to do this.  </p><p>More conversation is needed about an appropriate release cadence.  Releases that are too frequent will distract from developing new features. Infrequent releases, as we have seen, will push users to the development builds. The goal should be to strike a proper balance between them and increase the value of the stable release with frequent maintenance releases. </p><p>Our suggestion is to make major releases twice a year and point releases depending on the amount and severity of bugs we fix. As long as fixes come in small batches and aren’t fixing anything really bad, we can release them on a monthly basis. A fix for a severe bug like data loss would definitely call for an immediate release.</p><p>We also need to define a general timeframe within each release cycle: when we open the main development branch for new features, when we do a feature freeze, when we do a strings freeze, etc.</p><p>Beyond that, we will also need to revisit our patch inclusion policy to match a much shorter release cycle. This policy would also have to be updated for feature/improvement backports, which means we need criteria of what constitutes an easily portable change.</p><p>To discuss all these things, we created a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Ondsel-Development/discussions/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussion topic</a> on GitHub and invite you to provide your input.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The volunteer-driven development approach served the FreeCAD community well in the past, but it has become harder and harder to make significant changes.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Historically, the development process in the FreeCAD community has been entirely volunteer-driven. This approach served the community amazingly well — up to a point. We got a very capable 3D CA* program out of it, but as the project grew, it became harder and harder to make significant changes. </p><p>Case in point: the entire toponaming fix is going to span two major releases (0.21 and 1.0). Why? It involves patching a lot of code and writing a lot of unit tests. It also requires knowing the internals of FreeCAD very well and communicating well with lots of people. It takes a particular kind of mind to sit quietly for weeks on end and hack on a boring architectural fix. </p><p>Similarly, improving UX/UI requires specific hands-on experience, as well as ability to cooperate. Fixing one task panel or layout is easy.  Making the whole application feel consistent and polished is quite another. And developing a default assembly workbench implies not only being great at many things at once (math, data structure design, UX/UI), but also encouraging a consensus among multiple stakeholders.  Doing your own thing is infinitely easier.</p><p>Many developers, especially volunteers, join FOSS projects for fun, to learn something new, and to improve their skills.  These people play an incredibly important and central role in FreeCAD’s future.  Sadly, being an individual contributor has become less fun and harder for these same reasons. </p><p>The project is at an inflection point where the old way of working is stifling improvement and new methods are needed. The project is also large and mature enough to attract professional development. Ondsel is only the first company to do so, we have no doubts that more will follow.
What’s needed now is an approach to software development that lets commercial partners add value quickly but still lets individuals make significant contributions, influence the overall direction, and most importantly, have fun. </p><p>As a commercial company with paid developers, we have the opportunity to encourage a different way of working. We see five areas where the project has outgrown its historical development approach.  These are all areas that formally served FreeCAD well but are now holding it back.</p><ol><li><p>Project has historically had no roadmap. We introduced a global roadmap and have our own plan.</p></li><li><p>Project works in features. We're beginning to work in the CI methodology.</p></li><li><p>Project drives from pull requests. We drive from issues.</p></li><li><p>Project discusses important topics on the forum. We are using our blog and our GitHub tools to communicate and seek feedback.</p></li><li><p>The project community is mostly individual developers working independently. We work collaboratively and integrate multiple skill sets.</p></li></ol><p>Some of these changes are already finding their way into the upstream project, others will hopefully be adopted by the larger FreeCAD community too. We hope these changes not only speed up the pace of development but also make it easier for volunteers to contribute effectively.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="roadmap">Roadmap<a href="#roadmap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Roadmap" title="Direct link to Roadmap">​</a></h2><p>As a commercial partner, Ondsel isn’t focused only on the short term features and bugfixes.  We’ve also got our eyes on the long-term vision. We started by stepping back and looking at the big picture. What are the fundamental limitations that are holding FreeCAD back from widespread adoption?</p><p>We strongly believe that working off a roadmap will help the entire community to focus on important things and make faster progress by planning features and setting priorities. So we proposed a <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roadmap</a> for the core project that covers major topics that are universally acknowledged: model stability, integrated assembly workbench, better UX/UI and streamlined workflow, easier extensibility, better documentation etc.</p><p>Some of those items will be picked by volunteers For others, a team like Ondsel will have a better shot at completing a particularly sophisticated task.  In the latter case, we can communicate our proposal to the broader community and solicit input from users and contributors to shape the plan.</p><p>To that end, we are encouraging the use of <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Projects</a> functionality on GitHub to keep track of the progress on larger issues that are part of that roadmap.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="continuous-integration">Continuous Integration<a href="#continuous-integration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Continuous Integration" title="Direct link to Continuous Integration">​</a></h2><p>The project typically moves forward one feature at a time. A developer gets an ‘itch’ that they’d like to scratch and works on a feature until it’s complete. They do this work in a dedicated feature branch and then submit a PR to merge the feature branch. There’s two problems with this.</p><p>First, this approach doesn’t work for features or fixes that imply either cooperation of many volunteers or a long solo effort by one contributor. Especially in the latter case, there’s a huge risk that work will be abandoned before it’s completed.</p><p>Secondly, complex features and large changes result in massive pull requests that must be evaluated. Going over commits in a large branch can take a long time. Meanwhile, those feature branches must be continuously rebased until they are accepted and merged. All this means extra work for both the project maintainers and contributors. The FreeCAD community has grown to accept this reality as the normal state of affairs, “it’s done when it’s done”. The outcome of this, however, is that contributors burn out and release cycles grow longer, from an average of 200 days to almost 550 days.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Days between FreeCAD releases" src="/assets/images/days-between-freecad-releases-chart-2b688cb10de35cf5cc24a67e5a5f8ca5.png" width="1022" height="637" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>A better approach is to work in a continuous integration methodology. We can break up large features into many small, atomic commits that don’t break the master build. We can send pull requests for each of them allowing the work to be merged until the final feature is enabled. This will make the entire process far more manageable, which is especially important for modules where maintainers are volunteers. Here at Ondsel, we have already switched to this methodology as part of the work on fixing the toponaming issue.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="driving-from-issues">Driving from Issues<a href="#driving-from-issues" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Driving from Issues" title="Direct link to Driving from Issues">​</a></h2><p>Ondsel has been working with the FreeCAD developer community and the FPA to formalize the contribution process. The <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developers Guide</a> is one of the outcomes of that. </p><p>Unfortunately, many contributions are still received as PRs that have had no prior discussion. The way it usually works is that someone finds a bug or identifies a missing feature and sends a PR to fix the bug or add the feature. This may be the first time ever that the community has heard of it.</p><p>Out-of-the-blue patches like that can cause problems: </p><ul><li>The community agrees that the problem exists but disagrees about the solution.</li><li>Sometimes a lengthy debate ensues, whether the feature should be accepted at all, whether the assumed bug is actually a feature etc. </li><li>Sometimes a valid solution needs to be implemented elsewhere in the application but the contributor isn’t interested in doing that work because it doesn’t affect them personally.</li></ul><p>There are ways to manage development communication better.</p><p>Ondsel will drive from issues. We’ll submit issues for discussion ahead of time to verify that the bug or feature is legitimate. We can use the input provided by users and other contributors to figure out the best way to achieve the goal before we do the actual work. Then when the PR is finally submitted, the only remaining discussion should be about the quality of the code. We believe this will eliminate some conflict as well as late-stage user feedback, result in less patches sitting in the limbo and half cooked features, and let the entire upstream project move forward even faster.</p><p>We already started doing so, one example is a proposal for making assembly workbenches <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/9278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compatible</a> on the data structure level.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="moving-important-conversations-off-the-forum">Moving important conversations off the forum<a href="#moving-important-conversations-off-the-forum" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Moving important conversations off the forum" title="Direct link to Moving important conversations off the forum">​</a></h2><p>The FreeCAD forum has long been the center of the FreeCAD ecosystem. It is where development discussion has happened side-by-side with user support, general community discussion, and work coordination for translation, wiki, etc. As the project has grown, we’ve started to outgrow the forum, and communication has become less productive.</p><p>First, the amount of traffic means many important topics get lost. A topic about a bug can rapidly grow to multiple pages and dozens of replies. The conversation often gets off-topic, so it becomes impossible to keep up.</p><p>The same topics can get discussed many times in unrelated threads and multiple languages. Useful and important information becomes difficult to extract, and decisions never get recorded or followed up on.  Most troubling for a software project, the discussion never gets linked to the source code or a pull request discussion.</p><p>The forum still serves an important role but it is less and less effective for technical discussions about the source code and related topics. We think the project should embrace a wide set of communication tools that are each appropriate to the type of conversation needed.  Video meetings via Zoom and Jitsi are great for making plans. Real-time chats via Telegram, Gitter, Matrix, and Discord are great for working collaboratively on technical issues. </p><p>We encourage the project to keep technical discussion as close to the source code as possible. GitHub issues and pull requests allow a richer conversation in context with the source itself. Using labels and projects keeps conversations relevant and organized. This should help eliminate duplicate discussions and make useful input from users and contributors easy to locate and analyze.</p><p>Additionally, we use this blog for sharing ideas that are too broad for issues and pull requests but could serve as a reference on GitHub. The blog lets us take the conversation “up a level” and reflect on topics that deserve more time to consider.  We mostly rely on the traditional “problem statement -&gt; research -&gt; analysis -&gt; proposal” approach.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="collaboration">Collaboration<a href="#collaboration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Collaboration" title="Direct link to Collaboration">​</a></h2><p>Most FreeCAD contributors work independently. From time to time, they coordinate their efforts and work together to achieve a larger goal. This requires agreeing on a number of things: what work should be done exactly, who will do which part of it, what time frame for completion should be set etc. This is hard to do as there is little infrastructure or established processes for team work.</p><p>Ondsel engineers can work together in a more organized manner. We can set priorities and goals that are consistent with FreeCAD direction and also work with Ondsel’s product strategy. We can include outside experts and volunteer developers when required.</p><p>We think this kind of collaboration is the most important thing because it flows from doing all the other things better.  By planning, communicating, and working in small discrete steps we can share the burden and collectively move much faster.  We also avoid relying on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one or two people with special skills to keep the project afloat.</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion<a href="#in-conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to In Conclusion" title="Direct link to In Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>Since much of the work we do directly affects the upstream FreeCAD project, we expect that the proposed work methodology changes — planning the work, atomizing large changes, and keeping discussions structured — will result in a more streamlined development process overall. </p><p>It is our hope that at least some of these changes will prove to be efficient and will eventually become the standard for the larger FreeCAD community.</p><p>As we flesh out the details of new work processes, we will document them in <a href="https://ondsel.com/handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ondsel’s own developers’ handbook</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already have great tools for design. Where VR can really shine is in creating environments to experience those designs in context.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>VR CAD is usually portrayed like Tony Stark designing Iron Man suits, putting the emphasis on VR as an evolution of design tools. This is Hollywood stupid. VR design/UI isn't mature enough for that. Instead, we should be thinking about VR as a sharing environment where a designer can demonstrate a model in context. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vr-for-design-is-a-long-way-from-being-useful">VR for design is a long way from being useful<a href="#vr-for-design-is-a-long-way-from-being-useful" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to VR for design is a long way from being useful" title="Direct link to VR for design is a long way from being useful">​</a></h2><p>The current discourse around VR and CAD potential focuses too much on using VR for design: gamifying the experience and building things with goggles on. Design takes time—sometimes a LOT of it. Wearing VR gear for any period of time gets uncomfortable quickly and is both physically and mentally fatiguing. </p><p>We do however have existing tools and applications for design work that already work well (and have decades of investment and optimization to leverage). Our keyboards, mouses, and monitors are still the best tools for this job and still have their place. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-real-opportunity-experiencing-design-in-the-metaverse">The real opportunity: Experiencing design in the metaverse<a href="#the-real-opportunity-experiencing-design-in-the-metaverse" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The real opportunity: Experiencing design in the metaverse" title="Direct link to The real opportunity: Experiencing design in the metaverse">​</a></h2><p>By getting swept up in ideas about moving to VR for design work, we risk overlooking the more realistic, near-term potential of VR: creating an environment to experience a design in context.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="beyond-visual-twins">Beyond visual twins<a href="#beyond-visual-twins" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Beyond visual twins" title="Direct link to Beyond visual twins">​</a></h3><p>A digital twin is a virtual copy of something physical: an environment, system, asset, or process. It’s also dynamic, connecting real-world data to the twin, to help not just with visualization but with understanding and forecasting how the real thing will interact with its environment. For example:</p><blockquote><p>“Leaning on Omniverse, Ericsson created a digital twin of an entire city to determine the optimal deployment for their 5G rollout, using Omniverse to judiciously select and configure sites to maximize coverage and signal quality with minimal cost and complexity. To do so, Ericsson’s digital twin city tracks the physical world, with buildings and foliage 100% accurate, down to their surface materials and texture. In that world, Ericsson can accurately assess signal quality at any point in the city with a given deployment. And re-working sites— either upfront or at a later date for upgrade—can easily reveal how the coverage would improve (or not) in real time.” — Alex Herrera, <a href="https://www.cadalyst.com/collaboration/digital-twin/metaverse-separating-wheat-chaff-cad-perspective-78906" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Metaverse: Separating the Wheat from the Chaff, from a CAD Perspective</a></p></blockquote><p>So far though, the concept of digital twins tends to be limited to what we see, but with VR and AR (augmented reality) there’s great potential to take the concept of a digital twin beyond the visual. </p><blockquote><p>“What I've always been interested in is this idea of, how do we experience more of the things we're designing when it's on the other side of the glass? … What I long for is, for example, taking the many facets of a design and being able to see them work together … we should be able to take an object and, for example, turn it on. And we should see lights flash and you press a button and you understand how it operates. You should hear what it sounds like. … If I was a designer, I want to really understand the scale and proportion. I want to understand what it feels like, I want to see what happens as I interact with it. So these products that we design and make are so much richer.” — <a href="https://cesium.com/open-metaverse-podcast/cad-and-the-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carl Bass, former President and CEO of Autodesk</a></p></blockquote><p>Where VR and AR really shine is in providing <em>context</em> for what the user is experiencing when previewing or interacting with a design. The obvious use case is architecture, where you would be able to walk through a design in scale:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Tweet: Pascal Bornet" src="/assets/images/image1-da100ac552e6ee39643fe2f59e2361c0.webp" width="1210" height="1460" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The same is true for other physical designs. You could show how a part fits into a model (think about an exhaust system under a car). </p><p>You don’t just see the thing, you see the thing <em>in context</em>. You hear ambient sound, feel immersed, and can even interact with other people in a shared context. This is an ideal environment for discussing physical designs. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="immersive-remote-collaboration">Immersive remote collaboration<a href="#immersive-remote-collaboration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Immersive remote collaboration" title="Direct link to Immersive remote collaboration">​</a></h3><p>There’s also an obvious use case in enabling the people working on such designs to collaborate remotely with one another in a shared context. Site visits and to get stakeholders in the same room to look at a prototype, while still useful, would no longer be necessary. </p><p>This benefit extends beyond design though, to any remote collaboration. Imagine a FreeCAD HQ room in VR, for contributors to meet, have <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussions</a>, and make plans in real time. Whiteboards and issue boards on the walls would add context to those meetings in a way that is otherwise hard to recreate with remote meetings. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="making-3d-designs-more-accessible">Making 3D designs more accessible<a href="#making-3d-designs-more-accessible" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Making 3D designs more accessible" title="Direct link to Making 3D designs more accessible">​</a></h2><p>3D designs are like the source code of the design world: read much more than they are written. While source code is mostly read by programmers and compilers though, 3D designs are read by many different people across many roles… and other systems. Because 3D designs need to be read by so many, the long-term opportunity here is to make them more accessible by enabling people to experience them from anywhere, <em>in</em> context, and <em>outside</em> of a dedicated application. </p><p>If done well, the user experiencing the context doesn’t need to understand the controls of the software. They can look behind them by moving their head. They get an intuitive sense of scale because it’s related to their own bodies. The design becomes more useful by enabling people to access and experience it easily, in a range of different contexts. </p><p>This is another area of rapid innovation and Ondsel doesn’t have all the answers. What we want to do is enable the community of FreeCAD users to explore these ideas—o find new ways to collaborate, create, and share their designs with each other.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s hard to believe that it’s been just over three months since Ondsel started operations.  One hundred days, in fact.  I thought it would be fun to take a moment and consider what we’ve been able to accomplish in that time.</p><p>First, we built a team.  Besides myself, Ondsel now has five people working on the future of FreeCAD.  We were able to recruit, interview, hire, equip, and onboard five exceptionally talented people who hit the ground running and started contributing to FreeCAD.</p><p>We attended FOSDEM in Brussels in February where we got to meet with <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project leaders</a>.  We heard from many users who both love FreeCAD but are frustrated with the lack of progress on some big problems.  We learned a ton and we were able to build consensus on a path forward.</p><p>From that, we laid out a plan for finally resolving the topo-naming problem.  One of our people, <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnDupuyCOMO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@JohnDupuyCOMO</a> refined <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/8432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the plan</a> to incorporate <a href="https://twitter.com/RealThunder12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RealThunder</a>’s algorithm, and the developer community not only accepted it but started working with blazing speed to accomplish it.  The first phase was completed in only a couple of weeks.  Now we’ve started phase two.</p><p>We started building the Ondsel brand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that the study of assembly workbenches and tools is done, let's discuss key takeaways and propose a way forward for the project.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We started this series with the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assumption</a> that there is a strong community demand for a default assembly workbench in FreeCAD. The community discussion that followed that article confirmed our belief. We then researched existing options — <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 2</a>, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A2plus</a>, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 3</a>, and <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 4</a> — and even quickly studied <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">related workbenches and macros</a>.</p><p>Our research had a number of limitations though. We avoided exploring the earliest solutions such as the <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=3828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original workbench</a> by Jürgen Riegel and <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=1523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeGCS</a> because they were incomplete. We also decided against studying both <a href="https://github.com/JMG1/ExplodedAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploded Assembly</a> and <a href="https://github.com/microelly2/Animation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Animation</a> workbenches because this type of feature deserves dedicated attention.</p><p>From this research and the discussion that followed, we came away with a handful of important takeaways. We suggest that these ideas should influence the direction of the FreeCAD project.</p><p>In this article, we’ll describe what we learned. We’ve taken the liberty of making some specific recommendations for a way forward and we also discuss what we believe is Ondsel’s role.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="key-insights">Key Insights<a href="#key-insights" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Insights" title="Direct link to Key Insights">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-long-term-vision">The Long-Term Vision<a href="#the-long-term-vision" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Long-Term Vision" title="Direct link to The Long-Term Vision">​</a></h3><p>We started this conversation by calling for a solution that covers 80% of use cases. Based on our research and community feedback, we conclude that there is strong consensus around the higher-level characteristics of this integrated assembly workbench:</p><ul><li>Both top-down and bottom-up approaches equally first-class citizens</li><li>Simple enough to make quick alignments, but powerful enough for complex projects with nested sub-assemblies</li><li>Ability to resolve assembly constraints automatically and eventually simulate multi-body dynamics</li><li>An easy way to animate the assembly and detect collisions</li><li>Built-in BOM generation</li><li>PDM-ready</li><li>Compatible with other parts of FreeCAD and alternative assembly workbenches</li><li>Same license as FreeCAD (LGPL v2.1)</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-need-for-a-common-data-structure">The Need for a Common Data Structure<a href="#the-need-for-a-common-data-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Need for a Common Data Structure" title="Direct link to The Need for a Common Data Structure">​</a></h3><p>The existing assembly workbenches for FreeCAD are not mutually compatible. It isn’t possible for a user to switch between the options without losing data. This kind of compatibility is important and it starts with the data structure. Early in the forum discussion, Zolko noted the need for a standard, and we think he’s exactly right:</p><blockquote><p>…what we need is a default assembly DATA FORMAT that every assembly workbench can use. You can design solids in Part and PartDesign workbenches, where you begin with one, continue with the other, use Draft en-passant, and finish with some Part Booleans. You can even mix this with Curved Shape surfaces, Sheet Metal bending, and they all COOPERATE! Why should it be different for assemblies? What IS needed is to say: to be called a FreeCAD assembly workbench it needs to use the following data structure <!-- -->[…]<!-- --> and then let people implement the best approaches for that.</p></blockquote><p>We see the development of the common data structure as a priority requirement for an integrated solution. Users should be able to move between existing workbenches or migrate to newer ones without redoing an entire project.</p><p>A standardized data structure would also simplify developing in-house niche solutions where you need to run some extra simulations.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-we-should-talk-about-solvers-separately">Why We Should Talk About Solvers Separately<a href="#why-we-should-talk-about-solvers-separately" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why We Should Talk About Solvers Separately" title="Direct link to Why We Should Talk About Solvers Separately">​</a></h3><p>Past discussions about an assembly workbench have lumped the solver and the workbench into the same conversation. Separating the discussion has been helpful since these are, in fact, very different things. It is the solver which has been the most controversial part of previous discussions. Assembly 4 and Manipulator workbenches have demonstrated that, at least for some use cases, a solver isn’t even needed at all.</p><p>Among those who emphasize the need for a solver, agreement about requirements has been hard to find. The real world is messy and complex and full of unique problems that require custom solutions. One solver cannot possibly handle the variety of use cases that exist (think combined mechanical-thermal-electromagnetic simulations).</p><p>Some problems can be handled by 2D solvers, and we have some very nice options, including the one in the Sketcher workbench. </p><p>Other problems <em>require</em> a capable 3D solver and if we want FreeCAD to be competitive, it needs one. Unfortunately, we currently have no options at all. SolveSpace comes closest but its licensing (GPL v3+) makes it an unlikely choice for FreeCAD (LGPL v2.1). The development of solvers, both open and proprietary, is an area of rapid innovation. We have no way of knowing what will be available even five years from now.</p><p>Our insight is that the future integrated assembly workbench should have the following three essential characteristics with respect to a solver:</p><ul><li>Minimally functional and easy-to-use without any solver at all</li><li>Capable of using a solver if one exists</li><li>Solver-agnostic, with a possibility to use new solvers in the future</li></ul><p>Building the assembly workbench to be solver-independent provides the greatest flexibility for the project as a whole, users, and partners like Ondsel. It also provides the most options in the future.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-people-are-passionate-about-existing-solutions">Why People are Passionate About Existing Solutions<a href="#why-people-are-passionate-about-existing-solutions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why People are Passionate About Existing Solutions" title="Direct link to Why People are Passionate About Existing Solutions">​</a></h3><p>From past experience, we understood that this discussion might get emotional at times. Users are very passionate about the existing options. What we noticed was that their passion stems from two sources.</p><p><strong>Investment in climbing the learning curve.</strong> With three actively developed assembly workbenches today, users first have to learn enough to make a choice. Having made that choice, they don’t want to revisit it. Some users refuse to invest in even making the choice. They give up and move on. Here are a few examples from discussions about our initial proposal:</p><ul><li>“As a fairly new freeCAD user I have spent an innumerable amount of time attempting to choose which assembly workbench to use and more importantly learn how to use” (<a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=667457&amp;sid=3bec9fb58279fa4feba78c322c3c6b43#p667457" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FC forum</a>)</li><li>“I tried switching to FreeCAD a couple of years ago and the plethora of conflicting assembly solutions prevented me from doing so” (<a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=669635#p669635" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FC forum</a>)</li><li>“I haven’t explored any of the assembly benches as there is a big curve to even selecting one of them” (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCAD/comments/11r9j78/comment/jcajyiq/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>)</li><li>“It's painful to train anyone if there are four different assembly plugins and they all work slightly or drastically different” (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCAD/comments/11r9j78/comment/jc9j3tu/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>)</li></ul><p>Users who made a choice also made a significant investment to become proficient, because they saw the benefits of the tool they use. As a result, they often have little or no knowledge of the other options and no interest in learning if the current option meets their needs. At the risk of oversimplifying:</p><ul><li>A2plus users think it has a simple, natural, and straightforward workflow</li><li>A3 users think it’s the most feature-complete workbench of all</li><li>A4 users like how robust the LCS-based workflow is</li></ul><p><strong>Investment in their current models and assemblies.</strong> Users also have a large collection of projects that are built using one particular workbench. They are naturally reluctant to switch solutions if it means losing or redoing that work from scratch. Basically, they made a huge investment in their assembly WB of choice, and because of the lack of compatibility, they are now in an unintended vendor lock-in situation.</p><p><strong>What about features?</strong> Surprisingly, one thing we didn’t hear much was users championing one solution or another because it offered specific features. While the different solutions had strengths and weaknesses, all of the options offer similar capabilities.</p><p>Our key insight is that protecting the investment users have made is extremely important. Change will be hard, but we believe users will be willing to adopt an integrated solution if it is robust, relatively easy to learn, well documented, and if existing models can be migrated to it with minimal rework. They shouldn’t be forced to make the change before they are ready or before an integrated solution is mature enough for their needs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-about-the-workflow-and-uxui">What About the Workflow and UX/UI?<a href="#what-about-the-workflow-and-uxui" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What About the Workflow and UX/UI?" title="Direct link to What About the Workflow and UX/UI?">​</a></h3><p>Once solvers and data format are removed from the discussion, what’s left to discuss is the workflow. Regardless of how passionate the users are, the reality is that none of the existing assembly workbenches has a perfect workflow or user interface:</p><ul><li>A2plus requires conversion of parts created with other WBs.</li><li>A3 has so many constraint types that even experienced users get confused.</li><li>A4 requires time to set up local coordinate systems for all features that should be attached.</li></ul><p>There are ideas to borrow from all of them, but we don’t consider the workflow and UX/UI of any of the existing options, in their present form, to meet the long-term goals. Assembly 4, by virtue of its simplicity and solid design, would be a good starting point.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="recommendations">Recommendations<a href="#recommendations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Recommendations" title="Direct link to Recommendations">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="integrated-assembly-workbench">Integrated Assembly Workbench<a href="#integrated-assembly-workbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Integrated Assembly Workbench" title="Direct link to Integrated Assembly Workbench">​</a></h3><p>We suggest that FreeCAD must commit itself to an integrated assembly workbench — with great UX, documentation, translations, and compatibility with the rest of FreeCAD. </p><p>While the first iteration of the workbench can be feature-incomplete, this WB should support both simple and complex workflows. It should provide a solid foundation for future development of PDM integration, BOM extraction, collision detection, exploded assembly views, and animations.</p><p><strong>Ondsel’s role.</strong> We can participate in the planning, help organize the work, contribute code, test, and refine the solution. We can also contribute to the documentation and other essential parts of the project.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="standardized-data-structure">Standardized Data Structure<a href="#standardized-data-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Standardized Data Structure" title="Direct link to Standardized Data Structure">​</a></h3><p>We already explained the importance of having a common data structure earlier. Our recommendation is simply that this should be the first step, and it should involve all key stakeholders: core developers, maintainers of the other Assembly workbenches (kbwbe, Realthunder, and Zolko), and Ondsel. This should be undertaken and completed early enough that other workbenches can either support the standard directly or provide migration tools.</p><p>The approach in Assembly 4 is a serious contender for a starting point. Zolko has some very sensible ideas like having only one root assembly element in the project, wrapped into a Part container, with parts and sub-assemblies available as child elements.</p><p>The working group should also investigate what ISO 10303 has to offer but regardless of what is found, the focus should be on providing the best solution for FreeCAD and its users.</p><p><strong>Ondsel’s role</strong>. Again, we can participate but we can’t impose a standard unilaterally. In this case, we feel Ondsel’s participation not only represents our own interests but the interest of other future partners. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="powerful-performant-3d-solver">Powerful, Performant, 3D Solver<a href="#powerful-performant-3d-solver" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Powerful, Performant, 3D Solver" title="Direct link to Powerful, Performant, 3D Solver">​</a></h3><p>Let’s reiterate: a 3D solver is critical to make FreeCAD competitive for professional and commercial work. No viable solutions that are license-compatible currently exist.</p><p>The solver has to be written in C++ or another compiled language for acceptable performance. The development of a 3D solver is a massive, time consuming, and expensive endeavor. It is, by far, the hardest part of doing assembly right.</p><p>For ease of distribution, it’s best to make the solver part of the core FreeCAD. This also gives us a better shot at maintaining it and also makes it available for use in other workbenches (think Robot).</p><p><strong>Ondsel’s role.</strong> We want a solution that is fast, powerful, and supports future functionality like multi-body dynamics. Ondsel intends to begin developing such a solution, release its code under an appropriately permissive license, and submit PRs to include it in the FreeCAD source. Based on our understanding of the <a href="https://opencoreventures.notion.site/Open-Core-Business-Model-525879f382cb430e81274f669a026c15#764604b5c6db4107bb84bbc427d81b87" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Buyer-Based’ Open Core Model</a>, we think this is the right decision.</p><p>Having said that, it is essential to understand that Ondsel is a for-profit company and we are not profitable yet. We might fail before a solution is available. The project should not bet its future on our success. Moreover, the need to survive might force us to make the 3D solver or specific features available as paid options. This is also a risk area for the FreeCAD project. The community should prudently take steps to minimize the impact and ensure the viability of the integrated assembly workbench. </p><p>This aligns with our recommendation that the assembly workbench should be solver-agnostic, usable in solverless mode, supporting less powerful 2D solvers, but also able to take advantage of more powerful technology — including commercial options — if and when they are available.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="shipping-the-mvp">Shipping the MVP<a href="#shipping-the-mvp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Shipping the MVP" title="Direct link to Shipping the MVP">​</a></h3><p>We believe that a minimum viable assembly workbench (proof-of-workbench, if you will) should be shipped as part of FreeCAD as soon as possible to become a platform for testing the new 3D solver. The goal shouldn’t be feature completeness. Rather, we should focus on simplicity and stability and then iterate upon that to improve the workflow and user experience.</p><p><strong>Ondsel’s role.</strong> Once again, we can participate by providing leadership, organization, code, testing, and documentation but we cannot do it alone. We’re ready to start immediately.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion<a href="#in-conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to In Conclusion" title="Direct link to In Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>We thank everyone who participated in the discussion. Being able to test our ideas and expectations against feedback from avid users of existing assembly workbenches is priceless. </p><p>We know that the road to a world-class assembly system won’t be short and there will be plenty of bumps along the way. We also know we can’t do it alone. We look forward to collaborating with the FreeCAD community to bring this vision to life.</p><p>We are interested to hear your feedback on this plan. Please let us know what you think by commenting <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=76799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the forum</a> or <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Ondsel-Development/discussions/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on GitHub</a>. We will create a project in the GitHub tracker to plan the work and coordinate the many people it will require. Please let us know if you want to contribute to this effort.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before we summarize our findings, let's look at assembly-like workbenches and addons for FreeCAD that help aligning parts against each other.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the previous posts in this series we’ve already discussed reasons to create a <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">default assembly workbench</a> and then explored existing options: <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 2</a>, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A2plus</a>, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 3</a>, and <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 4</a>.</p><p>There are several more tools that provide a subset of their features, and these tools regularly come up in discussions on creating assemblies: the <a href="https://github.com/Freedman-CB1/BodyBuilder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BodyBuilder</a> macro, the <a href="https://github.com/easyw/Manipulator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manipulator</a> workbench, and the <a href="https://github.com/DeepSOIC/Part-o-magic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part-o-magic</a> workbench. Since none of them can realistically serve as a foundation for a potential default assembly workbench, in this review, we’ll focus on their interaction models to see what we can learn from them.</p><p>But before we do that, let’s quickly discuss the topic of exploded assemblies — a representation of the assembly design where parts are roughly in the right position, but at a certain distance from each other. We considered looking at the <a href="https://github.com/JMG1/ExplodedAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploded Assembly</a> workbench in this post, because creating such a view is a very common use case. However, after a quick study we found the following.</p><p>First of all, it’s done differently across available commercial CAD offerings. It’s a part of the assembly toolset in Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks, Siemens NX, Ansys SpaceClaim, and BricsCAD Mechanical. It’s an additional default tool in PTC Creo and Onshape. And it’s part of the animation feature set in Autodesk Inventor, Autodesk Fusion 360, and T-FLEX CAD. So there’s no one right way to do that.</p><p>In FreeCAD, there are at least two 3rd-party workbenches for animation that have tools for exploding an assembly, Exploded Assembly and <a href="https://github.com/microelly2/Animation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Animation</a>. Another workbench, <a href="https://github.com/Francisco-Rosa/FreeCAD-Movie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Movie</a>, suggests using a <a href="https://github.com/Francisco-Rosa/ExplodedAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fork</a> of the Exploded Assembly workbench. And there are <a href="https://jirivalasek.github.io/Animate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other workbenches</a> that deal with animating moving parts.</p><p>On one hand, this indicates that the FreeCAD community is leaning towards seeing this as part of the animation feature set. On the other hand, there are perfectly sensible use cases like technical illustrations where you might want to place an isometric view of an exploded assembly onto a TechDraw page, and that’s probably outside the animation workbench’s jurisdiction. So it makes sense to revisit this topic later when we can give it our full attention.</p><p>And now let’s get on with additional assembly-like tools.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bodybuilder-macro">BodyBuilder macro<a href="#bodybuilder-macro" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to BodyBuilder macro" title="Direct link to BodyBuilder macro">​</a></h2><p>According to the macro developer, ‘freedman’, the <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=5&amp;p=636992#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rationale</a> behind this project is this:</p><blockquote><p>I think many times new users and some of us need a model with just a few parts held together, we don't need the full assembler that does everything <!-- -->[...]<!-- -->.</p></blockquote><p>Getting started with this tool can be a challenge.  There is no step-by-step tutorial. There’s a <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=72997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum thread</a> with a couple of GIFs and a few test files, only. Here is how it works.</p><p>The general idea is that, while the BodyBuilder macro is <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Macros" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">running</a>, you select an object in the viewport, then a sketch in the tree view. As soon as you do that, the object in the viewport gets centered at that sketch’s origin.</p><p>But the points in sketches that you align objects to don’t all sit at (0;0;0) exactly, typically they are all over the place. So what you do when you create a sketch is you start it at the origin and then you use the Position property in Attachment Offset to move the sketch in the three dimensions. Once you set it up, you can align a body to that sketch.</p><p>Doing that means that the body’s Position (Placement) value changes to the point in space defined by the sketch's attachment offset.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="BodyBuilder macro running in FreeCAD" src="/assets/images/freecad-bodybuilder-viewport-ddde0a9329c548178e535b3d747aaa6c.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You have several options for what to do next when you want to move that object.</p><ul><li>You can use the Positioning menu of the macro to set a relative offset that will increment the absolute values.</li><li>You can set its position in absolute values, and for that the Properties dock is fairly sufficient.</li><li>Or you can use the on-canvas Transform tool.</li></ul><p>The macro has a kind of a menu, but really, it’s a different set of controls in generally the same space. The main menu allows looking at the reference sketch’s origin (has to be selected), setting X-Ray mode to the selected body to look through it, and switching to positioning settings. The positioning menu has offset, rotation etc. controls for the attached body. And the binding menu is where you initiate the binding of a body to a sketch or delete an existing binding.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="BodyBuilder macro menu structure" src="/assets/images/freecad-bodybuilder-menu-cc93e08e393c29a2e7fc350b717f86e0.webp" width="1364" height="1146" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Left to right: main menu, positioning menu, binding menu.</p><p>Once you get the hang of it, the macro works. It’s three clicks away if you have the Macro toolbar present, or a few more, if you have to use the menu. Workflow-wise, the main problem is repositioning the sketch origin, which takes some extra work. The trick is to open the macro menu, go to Positioning, double-click the sketch to start editing it, then add a point where the offset should be, enable the “Reposition Sketch origin” checkbox, then click on that newly added point. This will get you the desired attachment offset value.</p><p>So much like Assembly 4, BodyBuilder is built on top of existing core features, but it takes time to set everything up as compared to using constraints in Assembly 2/2+/3 workbenches.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-manipulator-workbench">The Manipulator workbench<a href="#the-manipulator-workbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Manipulator workbench" title="Direct link to The Manipulator workbench">​</a></h2><p>This workbench focuses on moving and aligning objects and does not allow creating permanent attachments with fixed degrees of freedom. The three major groups of tools are <em>Mover</em> tools, <em>Align</em> tools, and <em>Measure</em> tools. All three have floating palettes that can be docked.</p><p>The Mover toolset is how you move and rotate selected objects along the selected axis using numeric input. All changes are relative and affect the absolute position of the object: e.g. if your part is already shifted and rotated, further changes will increment existing displacement and rotation.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Mover tools in the Manipulator workbench" src="/assets/images/freecad-manipulator-mover-tools-3333fe850e825beb1ce472fc8d3729a2.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>If it wasn’t for the option to align the view to a selected face and then rotate around this custom axis, the entire set of Mover tools could be considered a duplication of the existing Placement functionality that allows to adjust absolute values with expressions.</p><p>The Align tools allow attaching objects by points, edges, centers, and planes to each other. The user has control over a number of options, such as:</p><ul><li>whether the bounding box or the center of mass of the reference object should be used;</li><li>whether the alignment normal is inverted;</li><li>which axis the object should be centered on (any combination is possible).</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Align tools in the Manipulator workbench" src="/assets/images/freecad-manipulator-align-tools-d51ee7c3a4a5ecf1ad96bcfd47a20c94.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>And then there’s the Measure tool that can get the radius of an arc or a circle, the length of an edge, the angle between two edges, and more. It works pretty much the same way as in other software: you need to select the first and the second elements when measuring distances between two objects or an angle between two edges. A single click on an arc or a circle will get you the radius, and a single click on an edge will get you its length. The extra label is optional and can be disabled.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Measure tools in the Manipulator workbench" src="/assets/images/freecad-manipulator-measure-tools-51aba437884566156314a9e1e1c0b83e.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This Measure tool has been modified and repurposed for the Assembly 4 workbench, so if you see similarities between them, this is not a coincidence.</p><p>The part of the feature set that deals with transforming and aligning objects has documentation and 3rd party video tutorials. Work with datum objects (points, lines, planes, LCSs), however, is entirely undocumented.</p><p>In a nutshell, despite its basic feature set and a certain overreliance on icons, the Manipulator workbench is a handy toolbox for making quick alignments. Moreover, the tools it provides are accessible in other workbenches like Sketcher, Part, and PartDesign. All you need to do is docking the floating palettes for your convenience.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="part-o-magic-workbench">Part-o-magic workbench<a href="#part-o-magic-workbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Part-o-magic workbench" title="Direct link to Part-o-magic workbench">​</a></h2><p>The main point of this workbench is saner automatic management of the project hierarchy. PoM plugs into the core of FreeCAD and makes sure that all new objects are added to the active container no matter what workbench is currently used.</p><p>But there are other features like autohiding all parts and bodies other than the one you are currently editing until you are done. Or duplicating objects, transferring them from one container to another, locating dependencies etc. All that has its use when working on complex assemblies, particularly with the top-down approach to designing.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The Part-o-magic workbench" src="/assets/images/freecad-part-o-magic-workbench-fd504301412e20da0f9e82b04515eb4f.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As FreeCAD starts gaining some of the features that PoM provides, the workbench is likely to grow obsolete.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>The main takeaway from exploring BodyBuilder and Manipulator is that there is a demand for making quick attachments of a small number of parts. So further work on a default assembly workbench should include research focusing on two things. First of all, it’s useful to understand the exact reasons people try to avoid using full-blown assembly workbenches for such tasks. Given that the UX/UI of BodyBuilder and Manipulator are not particularly easier than those of all assembly workbenches we reviewed earlier, this has to do either with project hierarchy, or with using constraints and solvers, or both. Secondly, the future default assembly workbench should be designed in a way that would keep the workflow lightweight and straightforward for these “simple” use cases.</p><p>As for Part-o-magic, some of the tools, like the deep copy of containers, look like features that belong to upstream FreeCAD.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-up">Next Up<a href="#next-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next Up" title="Direct link to Next Up">​</a></h2><p>We are concluding the series. In the next post, we will summarize our findings, as well as the takeaways from the public discussion, and suggest a way forward.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this next installment of the assembly series we are looking at Assembly4, the workbench with workflow built around local coordinate systems.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the previous posts in this series, we talked about the need for a <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">default assembly workbench</a> in FreeCAD and reviewed <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 2</a>, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A2plus</a>, and <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 3</a>. Let’s talk about Assembly 4.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="history">History<a href="#history" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to History" title="Direct link to History">​</a></h2><p>The project was started by Zolko in 2019 after some experiments with building assemblies without solvers. Zolko came to the community with extensive knowledge of other CAD programs such as Pro/E, Catia, and T-Flex, but he was very (and probably needlessly) humble about his programming skills.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Assembly 4 commits" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-4-commits-03bf4b69f69316fe72612d0958b6db0d.png" width="1760" height="557" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Just like with other assembly workbenches, much of the development has been affected by the user community, and a number of features have been contributed by other developers. So far, A4 is the only assembly workbench where the development pace is about the same as it was when the project started, and Zolko isn’t done yet.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workflow-and-ease-of-use">Workflow and ease of use<a href="#workflow-and-ease-of-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use" title="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use">​</a></h2><p>Assembly 4 relies on several core principles.</p><p>First off, it is built around the <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/App_Link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App:Link API</a> that we already mentioned in previous posts in the series. In a nutshell, rather than creating a full copy of a part, FreeCAD will reference it. This makes models cleaner, and you always work with up-to-date geometry. The workbench also has the concept of a variant link which allows referencing the same object multiple times and using different parameters for each of the linked instances.</p><p>Secondly, rather than aligning characteristics of two parts (e.g. vertex to vertex), the workbench maps one local coordinate system (LCS) to another. Each body in a part can have multiple local coordinate systems. For example, the part on the screenshot below has 5 of them:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Multiple LCSs in a part" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-4-multiple-lcs-12ec72cd93b2bf559c95885d3e675868.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>When an LCS is originally created, it is attached to a very specific feature of a part. However, if the geometry of that part changes, the LCS stays where it was. Which makes it unaffected by the dreaded toponaming issue (now being finally taken care of in upstream FreeCAD). The kind of a feature an LCS is attached to defines what attachment options are available.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Picking features to attach an LCS to" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-4-picking-features-for-lcs-7e5f1da6734e29ce645cf0dbed702135.png" width="1840" height="1205" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Then when a new part is inserted into an assembly, the user specifies the parent part (which part to attach to), the source LCS (from the newly inserted part), and the target LCS (from the parent part):</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Mapping LCSs in Assembly 4" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-4-mapping-lcs-33e202f441562b00ea16e8c3b7dbbf17.png" width="1584" height="886" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Once both LCSs are aligned, all six degrees of freedom are fixed, and thus parts stay attached no matter what. It is, however, possible to “release” a DOF by using the attachment offset property and expressions.</p><p>We’ve seen multiple testimonials that the approach to assembling a model through LCS proves to be more predictable and robust. </p><p>On the flip side, the process of setting all LCSs is rather tedious, and attaching one part to another means you have to make more clicks than what you typically get with regular constraints.</p><p>Finally, Assembly 4 supports both <a href="https://caeuniversity.com/bottom-up-and-top-down-approach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top-down and bottom-up</a> design models. We do need to point out though that with the bottom-up approach, it is impossible to insert a part from an external file without opening it as a document.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features">Features<a href="#features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Features" title="Direct link to Features">​</a></h2><p>Because of how the workflow is implemented, Assembly 4 doesn’t have rows and rows of buttons to go through when you need to align one part with another. A large part of the feature set is about managing your assembly: creating new bodies and groups, inserting parts (there’s also a simple integration with the Fasteners workbench), mapping LCSs to each other etc. Apart from LCS, A4 allows creating more datum types: plane, axis, and point. Internally, those are all PartDesign objects.</p><p>A4 comes with its own tools for creating mirrored, linear, and circular arrays, as well as a measure tool:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Measure tool" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-4-measure-tool-a465016615cbcb387ba57a1decfebecb.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For animation, Assembly 4 uses variables and <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Expressions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expressions</a>. For example, if you need to rotate a part, what you do is create a new variable and set it e.g. to 0, then use that variable in the <em>Angle</em> placement property of your part, then open the animation dialog, select the variable to animate, set min and max values to feed into the variable, as well as the increment value, and run the animation.  </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Animation in Assembly 4" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-4-animation-b5757dd5ee22b5359e5f2b0c9551739e.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Theo Janssen’s <a href="https://www.strandbeest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strandbeest</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Examples/tree/master/Asm4_Tutorial4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">model by Zolko</a> (CC0-1.0 license) </p><p>The implementation is somewhat technical, but it works. The downside of all this is that due to the incomplete multithreading support in FreeCAD you can’t really stop the animation until the current cycle is over. Unfortunately, while animation does the trick in some cases, collision detection would still be really useful.</p><p>Despite the initial idea to not use a solver that got the entire Assembly 4 adventure going, Zolko did end up creating a solver to recompute all the links and placements in an assembly. In fact, as user ‘aapo’ <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=670464#p670464" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained in a recent discussion</a>, A4 has <em>multiple</em> solvers and can use custom external ones. Even more, there’s a branch called <a href="https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Assembly4/compare/master...solver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘solver’</a> waiting to be completed and merged. It brings the A2plus solver to Assembly 4.</p><p>The workbench has good if somewhat scattered documentation. There are <a href="https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Assembly4/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instructions</a> for new users that explain features, basic concepts, and workflow. There are also <a href="https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several tutorials</a> written by the principal developer in a dedicated GitHub repository. And some of the user documentation is in the <a href="https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Assembly4/tree/master/Examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Examples</a> folder of the main GitHub repository.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consistency">Consistency<a href="#consistency" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Consistency" title="Direct link to Consistency">​</a></h2><p>Assembly 4 does nearly everything in dialogs in the Combo View, which is a fairly standard practice. No surprises there.</p><p>The workbench can work with parts created by other assemblies, although in our testing it seems like a good idea creating local coordinate systems in those parts prior to inserting them for simplicity’s sake.</p><p>There have been <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=10&amp;t=40363" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a number of problems</a> getting A4 to work well with the TechDraw workbench. Most of them reportedly have been fixed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stability">Stability<a href="#stability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stability" title="Direct link to Stability">​</a></h2><p>From the Issues section on GitHub and the forum it appears that Assembly 4 is very stable. Users mostly have problems with the <a href="https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Assembly4/blob/master/Examples/ConfigBOM/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill of Materials</a> feature (there have been <a href="https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Assembly4/pull/403" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent fixes</a> to address some of the issues). In our limited testing, A4 crashed a few times — mostly, when editing datum objects. The number of actual bug reports (rather than feature requests) on GitHub is very low (just 1 as of March 27). However, a number of bugs are known and reported to the forum.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="performance">Performance<a href="#performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Performance" title="Direct link to Performance">​</a></h2><p>We found some complaints about A4 being slow with complex assemblies. One workaround that appears to improve the situation is disabling the preselection highlight (Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Display &gt; Colors).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development-status">Development Status<a href="#development-status" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development Status" title="Direct link to Development Status">​</a></h2><p>Assembly 4 is an active project with a growing share of new contributors. There have been multiple tagged releases, and the latest internal version update was in February 2023.
Collectively, the community around Assembly 4 keeps the number of pull requests to an absolute minimum (just 3 open out of 245 ever submitted, as of March 27). Zolko responds to most of the bug reports within a day or two, although fixing some of the bugs may take longer than that.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>Assembly 4 relies on local coordinate systems to attach parts to each other. The workbench is fairly robust, there are very few severe issues reported by users. However, the LCS approach — as implemented in A4 — is low-level and implies a somewhat tiresome process of setting everything up.</p><p>The project has a small active team of contributors who keep the amount of unresolved issues and unmerged patches as low as possible. We also found the user community to be really enthusiastic and passionate about the project.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-up">Next up<a href="#next-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next up" title="Direct link to Next up">​</a></h2><p>In the next installment, we’ll take a slight detour and explore several assembly-like solutions: the Manipulator and Part-o-Magic workbenches, as well as the BodyBuilder macro.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the fourth part in the series where we explore the possibility of creating a default assembly workbench for FreeCAD. We started out with a <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conversation</a> about why we need a default assembly workbench in the program, then <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviewed Assembly 2</a> and <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A2plus</a>. Now let’s talk about the Assembly 3 workbench.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="history">History<a href="#history" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to History" title="Direct link to History">​</a></h2><p>In 2013, Jonathan Westhues took the FOSS community by surprise releasing the source code of <a href="https://solvespace.com/index.pl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SolveSpace</a>, his parametric 2D/3D CAD software built around a very capable custom solver. Some 4 years later, Zheng Lei aka “realthunder” created a Python binding for the solver, then used it to create his own assembly workbench for FreeCAD.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Commit to Assembly 3 over time" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly3-commits-74dd6007bd2a4cd50c76d386f0c5e1dd.png" width="1761" height="554" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Further changes in the workbench required <a href="https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patching FreeCAD</a>, so realthunder created a friendly fork of the entire program, which over time became his primary project with many other changes and add-ons not available in upstream FreeCAD by default: the pie menu, transparent docks, and others.</p><p>Some of the architectural changes have already been merged to upstream FreeCAD, others are getting there. The Assembly 3 workbench continues to be maintained and is available to users of upstream FreeCAD as an addon and is now part of this larger project, the ‘LinkStage’ fork.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workflow-and-ease-of-use">Workflow and ease of use<a href="#workflow-and-ease-of-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use" title="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use">​</a></h2><p>Assembly 3 is substantially different from other assembly workbenches in multiple aspects. Here are some of its most significant characteristics.</p><p><strong>Project hierarchy.</strong> In A3, an assembly consists of constraints, elements, and parts. Elements are the features of parts that are used to create a constraint, e.g. a point of one part and a plane of another part. Assemblies can contain sub-assemblies, in which case each sub-assembly will carry its own set of constraints, elements, and parts. This approach makes navigating a complex project fairly straightforward.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Project hierarchy in Assembly 3" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly3-project-hierarchy-f069e78b9d5c0571aba74ae9865e8535.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><a href="https://github.com/Nemesis81/GraberI3_Freecad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graber I3 model by Nemesis81</a></p><p><strong>Top-down design model.</strong> This approach is technically available in A2 and A2plus, but it is not a recommended way of using those workbenches. Assembly 3 makes the top-down design model a first-class citizen. You can create new parts, then drag them into the Parts section of the project tree, then they will become usable in the assembly.</p><p><strong>Bottom-up design model.</strong> This is likely how most A3 users approach creating assemblies. The workbench provides two ways to build an assembly from parts saved as external files: importing from STEP files or linking (see below) FreeCAD projects that are already opened in the program.</p><p><strong>Links.</strong> A3 is not the only assembly workbench to rely on the <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/App_Link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App::Link API</a> to reference objects instead of copying them, Assembly 4 also does it. But A3 is what this API was designed for in the first place. The general idea is that if you have e.g. 4 screws of the same type to fix a motherboard to a plastic box, you don’t need 4 instances of the same screw geometry. You only need one part that you can reuse via links.</p><p>Creating a link, however, is all not at all obvious and requires performing a particular sequence of actions: selecting a part (Body object) in the project tree, then selecting an assembly document in the document tabs, then clicking a Link button in the toolbar. Figuring this out without reading documentation or watching a tutorial or asking on the forum is all but impossible.</p><p><strong>Fixing parts and freezing sub-assemblies.</strong> While fixing a part in A2plus is a property of a part, the A3 approach is to select a feature and assign a “Locked” constraint to it to eliminate all or some degrees of freedom (this depends on the type of the selected feature). The idea of locking something entirely goes even further. When working on a complex assembly, a particularly useful way to simplify computations is to freeze a sub-assembly. Such a sub-assembly is considered fixed by the solver and is therefore excluded from update calculations.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features">Features<a href="#features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Features" title="Direct link to Features">​</a></h2><p>Assembly 3 is the most feature-packed of all existing assembly WBs. It comes with over 40 constraint types, various helper tools, means to control workplanes, and more. It also has a dynamic solver, so you can move parts under constraints.</p><p>The workbench does its best to keep track of degrees of freedom to avoid overconstraining an assembly. However, in doing so, it doesn’t make it easy to indicate where the problem is exactly. All it does is notifying the user that there are inconsistent constraints. It is up to the user to locate the offensive elements and constraints.</p><p>There are more caveats. In particular, the vast amount of features in this workbench raises the expectations for UX/UI. Assembly 3 has an overwhelming UI. It comes with no less than six toolbars, three out of which are different groups of constraints.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Assembly 3 toolbars" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly3-toolbars-d58f25c6ecc6f4d694d53caa0a082150.png" width="1499" height="214" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>There’s the main constraints group and two additional groups of constraints. This takes a lot of getting used to. We’ve seen experienced users of the workbench making really useful elaborate tutorials about it and yet failing to locate the constraint they need on the first attempt.</p><p>Things don’t get much better with the <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/ModernUI_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ModernUI</a> add-on that creates a Ribbon-like top toolbar. You get readable labels (something the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jef Raskin</a> would appreciate), but you also get a large scrollable area:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Assembly 3 with a Ribbon-like toolbar" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly3-with-ribbon-like-ui-b2272e0aaf11cb3df1e2d74cc428d4cc.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><a href="https://github.com/Nemesis81/GraberI3_Freecad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graber I3 model by Nemesis81</a></p><p>Assembly 3 is not uniquely complex here. Arch, FEM, TechDraw, and a few other workbenches also have a similar or even larger amount of UI to deal with. This suggests that there may be a need for a general UX/UI review and a better strategy for organizing the user interface and designing the interaction — something that would be solved on the core level and then propagated to all workbenches, default and 3rd-party alike.</p><p>Three sorely missing features are collision detection, visual control over degrees of freedom, and the generation of BOM. Collision detection was <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=253170#p253170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planned</a> back in 2018, the idea was to use the <a href="https://pybullet.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bullet</a> physics engine, but this hasn’t materialized yet. Regarding DOF control, it is virtually impossible to find out how many degrees of freedom a part has without trial-and-error by attempting to transform it and — sometimes — looking at the output log in the built-in console (A2plus solves that by optionally displaying an indicator for each part in the viewport). And as for BOM, realthunder already <a href="https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Expression-and-Spreadsheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explored in detail</a> the requirements for developing BOM generation two years ago, but there is no code yet.</p><p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Assembly3_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wiki page</a> for the assembly at FreeCAD’s website provides some basic documentation on features, and the project’s <a href="https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">own wiki</a> explores basic concepts of A3 and provides several tutorials. However, neither can serve as a reference guide, hence finding out what some of the features do will require original research by users. Notably, there’s a lot of YouTube tutorials on using Assembly 3. Some of the most prolific A3 educators are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OficineRobotica/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oficine Robotica</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OficineRobotica/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joko Engineeringhelp</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consistency">Consistency<a href="#consistency" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Consistency" title="Direct link to Consistency">​</a></h2><p>The workbench is generally consistent with how the rest of FreeCAD operates. In our testing, nothing stands out as particularly peculiar. A3 will also use parts created with other workbenches as long as the imported parts are moved into the Parts section of the assembly’s hierarchy.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Assembly3 project in LinkStage branch" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly3-graber-i3-model-3108054c6b6643471f01af9c22c78bef.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><a href="https://github.com/Nemesis81/GraberI3_Freecad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graber I3 model by Nemesis81</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stability">Stability<a href="#stability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stability" title="Direct link to Stability">​</a></h2><p>Assembly 3 currently has over 300 unresolved bugs and feature requests filed to its <a href="https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue tracker</a>. However, this cannot be used as a sole indicator of the maintainer’s responsiveness: for some reason, it’s fairly common for users to report bugs associated with FreeCAD itself rather than with the workbench in question. Given that the ‘Linkstage’ fork of FreeCAD also has over 300 unresolved bug reports and feature requests, this is obviously too much for one person to handle, even though he gets some help with triaging reports.</p><p>None of the currently open bug reports are crash reports for the Assembly 3 workbench. Having said that, we did experience a few random crashes when working with the WB. We also looked at workbench crashes reported in the past and found that realthunder pays a lot of attention to that and typically fixes those within several days.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="performance">Performance<a href="#performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Performance" title="Direct link to Performance">​</a></h2><p>While it’s possible to exclude sub-assemblies from computation by freezing them and thus saving the resources for when they are needed, this will not be sufficient in all use cases. With complex assemblies (over a hundred parts), A3 can become really slow. </p><p>Moreover, even in simple use cases (two parts, two constraints), Assembly 3 will often fail to perform an axial rotation smoothly with 1 DOF left, while the rotation increment is as small as 1°.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development-status">Development Status<a href="#development-status" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development Status" title="Direct link to Development Status">​</a></h2><p>Although there have been contributions from at least a dozen more people, realthunder remains the author of 92% of all commits to the workbench since project’s inception. The project is maintained, however its active development phase ended in 2019. The last workbench release was tagged in 2020 and the latest internal version is 0.11.4 from November 2022. We also found that the development remains uncoupled from the upstream SolveSpace project: multiple changes and new features related to constraints appear to have never made its way to the workbench.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="legal-status">Legal Status<a href="#legal-status" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Legal Status" title="Direct link to Legal Status">​</a></h2><p>Because Assembly 3 relies on a fork of SolveSpace’s source code, it’s available under the terms of GPLv3+. This makes its inclusion in the FreeCAD application problematic. Thus the workbench can only be installed separately in upstream FreeCAD as an addon.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>Assembly 3 is substantially more advanced than either A2 or A2plus workbenches: generally better workflow, better support for bottom-up design, better-designed project hierarchy, vastly more constraint options, and the list goes on. The project also has an avid user community and the developer is typically fast to respond to reports of severe bugs.</p><p>At the same time, A3 has a number of usability issues and important missing features such as BOM generation. The solver’s license also makes this workbench an unlikely choice for a foundation of a potential default workbench in FreeCAD.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-up">Next up<a href="#next-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next up" title="Direct link to Next up">​</a></h2><p>Now that we’ve explored Assembly 3, we are getting closer to the end of the series. In the next installment, we’ll take a close look at the Assembly 4 workbench developed by Zolko.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the assembly workbenches study, we are looking at A2plus, a stable workbench with simple workflow]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’ve already talked about the need for a <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">default assembly workbench</a> in FreeCAD and <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviewed Assembly 2</a>. Now let’s get into the nitty-gritty of the A2plus workbench.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="history">History<a href="#history" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to History" title="Direct link to History">​</a></h2><p>A FreeCAD user kbwbe started working on this project in 2018 following <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=1&amp;t=29207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experiments</a> with a new solver developed on top of the pre-existing Assembly 2 workbench:</p><blockquote><p>I developed a small prototype of yet another solver. It is in a very early state now and is only capable of handling plane/circularedge/axis-constraints. But it can easily be extended. It consists only of one file, which is attached. The base concept is inspired by physics. <!-- -->[...]<!-- --> It is just a prototype and many things are still missing. But the idea seems to work. I am working with a refurbished assembly2-workbench. I like the base concepts of it very much and did some bigger projects with it. </p></blockquote><p>Having received initial feedback, kbwbe created a <a href="https://github.com/kbwbe/A2plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public repository</a> on GitHub and continued hacking on the new workbench publicly.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Commits History for the A2plus Workbench" src="/assets/images/freecad-a2plus-wb-commits-9185649cf50276951e2453253a69253b.png" width="1758" height="558" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Despite an activity plunge during the pandemic, A2plus is still being actively developed and receives new features and bug fixes.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workflow-and-ease-of-use">Workflow and ease of use<a href="#workflow-and-ease-of-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use" title="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use">​</a></h2><p>A2plus follows the same general idea as its predecessor: create parts as separate files, align them with constraints, solve. Just like Assembly 2, this workbench supports sub-assemblies.
There are some differences though. The one that stands out immediately is that, rather than creating one constraint object in the project tree, A2plus creates references to the same constraint in both involved parts.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A2plus Constraints in the Project Tree" src="/assets/images/freecad-a2plus-constraints-in-project-tree-77a47f6284ea3000322cdf7feff1d058.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Another difference is that a part in A2plus is a special type of an object. So it’s possible to create a new part from within the workbench and fill it with objects e.g. in the Part Design workbench. But the part will have to be manually converted to an A2plus part to become usable in the workbench. The caveat here is that even then such a part will not be added to the BOM: only the parts imported from external files will be displayed there. Overall, the top-down design approach is not favored by A2plus, as earlier <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=1&amp;p=265666#p265666" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted by kbwbe</a> in the FreeCAD forum:</p><blockquote><p>Leaving PartDesign bodies within the assembly is not the intended workflow. Best way is to import everything. Converting is also not the preferred way. Even all parametrics of the parts get lost.</p></blockquote><p>Unlike Assembly 2, the A2plus workbench can also load user-selected objects from another FreeCAD project. In this case, the workbench will reference the object from the file, so FreeCAD will pick any changes made to the original project when you click the Update button.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Importing Objects from a FreeCAD Project File" src="/assets/images/freecad-a2plus-load-objects-from-fc-file-b0059d99f66a4072ebd2a1577442fcc7.png" width="1234" height="829" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In terms of general user experience, A2plus is a major improvement over Assembly 2. Here are some examples of user-visible changes:</p><ul><li>When features (points, planes etc.) of multiple parts are selected, the workbench automatically makes available only the constraints that can be used with these features. This removes a lot of guesswork for new users.</li><li>Imported parts can easily be opened for editing as separate documents. All edited parts then can be updated with a single click.</li><li>When cleaning up an assembly, it’s possible to easily delete all constraints associated with a part.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features">Features<a href="#features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Features" title="Direct link to Features">​</a></h2><p>The workbench has a respectable set of constraints: Point-to-Point, Point-on-Line, Point-on-Plane, Sphere-to-Sphere, Circular-Edge, Axis-to-Axis, Axis-to-Plane, Axis-Plane-Normal, Angular Axis-to-Plane, Planes-Parallelism, Planes-Coincident, Angled-Planes, Center-of-Mass. This covers a variety of use cases.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Constraints Available in A2plus" src="/assets/images/freecad-a2plus-constraint-options-136c354eb13a807fb6c2c41bbbb20675.png" width="1857" height="1085" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>A2plus comes with an autosolver. The way it works, however, is somewhat unreliable. Case in point: select two planes, create a Plane-Coincident constraint, solve, accept. Then select the constraint and change its Offset parameter in the Combo View. The autosolver will not update the position of the object that has the first plane, you will have to click the Solve button for this change to take effect.</p><p>There’s a number of convenience features specific to A2plus (as compared to Assembly 2) such as placing labels on parts in the viewport for easier navigation or making parts’ fills transparent.
The behavior of A2plus is configurable. Settings are available in the Preferences dialog:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A2plus Preferences" src="/assets/images/freecad-a2plus-wb-preferences-aabfacf6943b50156010c4255d5892e9.png" width="1612" height="1004" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Some features of the original Assembly 2 workbench are unavailable. Notably, the animation of the assembly for collision analysis is missing.</p><p>The A2plus workbench has a good <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/A2plus_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reference guide</a> on FreeCAD’s wiki but lacks official tutorials that explain the workflow. The community, however, stepped up and provided a sufficient number of YouTube tutorials on using A2plus for a variety of use cases: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI4trcyFwvs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mechanical design</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIv15hX6Isw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">woodworking</a>, etc.</p><p><strong>Update 2023-03-26:</strong> There is at least <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=46024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one documented case</a> where the precision of the A2plus solver was not sufficient to get the job done. The workbench developer <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=395617#p395617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> this by having to find a compromise between speed (responsiveness of the WB) and accuracy due to limited calculation power available to a solver written in Python.<sup id="fnref-1-05cd54"><a href="#fn-1-05cd54" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consistency">Consistency<a href="#consistency" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Consistency" title="Direct link to Consistency">​</a></h2><p>A2plus does a few things differently from many other workbenches. The most user-visible difference is how constraint settings are displayed. When a new constraint is being added, FreeCAD displays a floating dialog:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Constraint Properties in A2plus" src="/assets/images/freecad-a2plus-wb-constraint-settings-5e2a1276923b19a0cd25fbee770e8540.png" width="1347" height="539" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Double-clicking the constraint in the project tree reopens this floating dialog. However, the very same information is displayed in the Combo View. So there’s two competing approaches to editing settings of a constraint.</p><p>Similarly, the first button in the Constraint toolbar opens another floating window that duplicates the list of constraints that is already available in that toolbar. This is not a common (although fairly optional-to-use) UI solution for FreeCAD.</p><p>As already noted, some objects require a conversion to an A2plus part, like the basic 3D objects created in the Part workbench. At the same time, this assembly workbench has no problem working with parts created in e.g. SheetMetal WB.</p><p>One important caveat of A2plus is that it doesn’t use the standard <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/App_Link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App::Link</a> machinery to reference objects in other documents. Parts added to the document this way cannot be used in an assembly. </p><p>Some actions, like adding a part from an external file are not correctly added to the undo buffer so they cannot be reverted in the normal way.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stability">Stability<a href="#stability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stability" title="Direct link to Stability">​</a></h2><p>As of publishing this overview, there are no reported crashers that aren’t fixed. There haven’t even been many before: the issue tracker only lists 3 bugs in A2plus that ever crashed FreeCAD, and git log likewise lists only a few fixes for crashes. However, we were able to crash the program by pressing Ctrl+Z to undo while moving a part under constraints.</p><p>The main developer typically responds to bug reports within the first few days. There’s a small number of bug reports with mild severity from 2019 where either no detailed information was provided by the reporter, or the developer couldn’t replicate the issue, or the report slipped through developer’s fingers. The workbench occasionally exhibits inconsistent or glitchy behavior like failing to delete a conflicting constraint. Other than that, nothing particularly bad stands out.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="performance">Performance<a href="#performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Performance" title="Direct link to Performance">​</a></h2><p>Assemblies are inherently complex beasts. It takes a substantial amount of talent, time, and effort to make a fast solver — a combination that not every volunteer has at their disposal. We’ve definitely seen complaints like <a href="https://www.hobby-machinist.com/threads/freecad-assembly-a2plus-v0-4-54b.97301/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a> about performance issues in the A2plus workbench even with fairly simple assemblies. However, in our limited testing, we were unable to come up with conclusive evidence for assemblies “blowing up” after changes. Simple assemblies (up to 40 parts) did not represent a major issue for A2plus. But there was noticeable rendering slowdown when moving parts under constraints.</p><p>At least one of the reasons for possible performance issues according to the main A2plus developer is the inefficient use of memory. This is how he <a href="https://github.com/kbwbe/A2plus/issues/378#issuecomment-612878010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explains</a> it and goes on to give very useful hints about ways a programmer could deal with Python limitations:</p><blockquote><p>Memory management using Python as a programming language is not that easy and some memory leaks cannot be completely avoided. Python is keeping a lot of internal lists, which are immortal and their memory is not given back to the system during the lifetime of the program. So it is not possible to delete no more used objects from memory directly, as it is possible with "C/C++". Every object, which is not used anymore, is deleted (or sometimes it is not for various reasons), from Python's garbage collector.
The code can only be optimized in order to reduce memory consumption. (using slots, avoiding string concatenation etc). I will have a look at this next time, where it is possible. But this is a bunch of work and will need a lot of time. And it will never be perfect.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development">Development<a href="#development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development" title="Direct link to Development">​</a></h2><p>The main developer responds to proposed contributions rather fast: many PRs by drive-by contributors are merged within days of submission, sometimes on the same day. Just 1 out of 452 pull requests is sitting unapplied on GitHub.</p><p>In the fall of 2022, a new regular contributor joined the project. His activity now rivals that of kbwbe.</p><p>Unlike with the original Assembly 2 workbench that had zero releases, the main developer of A2plus regularly tagged releases until November 2022 (a total of 101 tags so far). Releases mostly represent one or two bug fixes.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="community">Community<a href="#community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Community" title="Direct link to Community">​</a></h2><p>A2plus has one of the longest dedicated threads in the forum. However, since 2021, the activity of discussions has noticeably decreased: just 16 messages in the main thread in 2021, and 12 messages in 2022. The reason for this is unclear but might indicate that the interest towards the workbench has been decreasing as users move to other options.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>A2plus represents a major improvement over the original Assembly 2 workbench in terms of both workflow, features, and usability. It has more types of constraints, more convenience features, and better supports single-user workflows. It’s also sufficiently stable and has two developers who actively merge patches from other contributors. At the same time, the workbench has some unconventional UX/UI solutions and is reportedly prone to performance issues that are not easily resolved.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-up">Next up<a href="#next-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next up" title="Direct link to Next up">​</a></h2><p>In the next installment, we’ll take a close look at Assembly 3, a workbench that actively uses a solver from another free/libre CAD program, SolveSpace.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.

In this part, we take a closer look at Assembly 2, one of the early approaches to adding this feature set to FreeCAD.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="history">History<a href="#history" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to History" title="Direct link to History">​</a></h3><p>A FreeCAD user publicly known as Hamish started this project in late 2014. This is the <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=4&amp;t=8577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original announcement</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I have written an assembly workbench for FreeCAD v0.15, which I am posting here for everyone's perusal. <!-- -->[...]<!-- --> I realize that there is mostly likely heavy development on FreeCAD's inbuilt assembly wb, which i could have just used for my assembly needs.
However since FreeCAD provides such an excellent environment for building custom wbs, I decided to rather write my own wb exactly tailored to my needs <!-- -->[...]<!-- -->
Hope someone else finds the assembly2 wb useful</p></blockquote><p>2015 was the most active year for the project. However, in 2016, the original developer <a href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=16591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stopped writing new code</a> and the next maintainer, Roland Frank, <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=25673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">passed away in 2017</a>. Hamish and another contributor, kbwbe, continued merging occasional pull requests: bug fixes, a Newton solver, and a port to Python 3 to make the workbench generally supported by newer versions of FreeCAD.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="commit graph" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-2-commit-history-cfa322b6f81b0b460534cef769ef0df3.png" width="1761" height="548" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Assembly2 Commit History</em></p><p>However, in 2018, kbwbe started working on a <a href="https://github.com/kbwbe/A2plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rewrite of Assembly 2</a> and eventually dropped out of contributing to this workbench. There have been no changes in the git repository since 2019.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workflow-and-ease-of-use">Workflow and ease of use<a href="#workflow-and-ease-of-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use" title="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://github.com/hamish2014/FreeCAD_assembly2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 2</a> only supports the bottom-up approach where you design and save parts as files and then import them for an assembly into a new FreeCAD project. It will read both FreeCAD, OBJ, IGES, and STEP files. The workbench expects that the user either enables the visibility of just one body in the design file or creates files with single-body parts. Sub-assemblies are possible, however.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graber I3 model by Nemesis81" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-2-01-500fa911f5bf96ffd089c232695b49b8.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q">
<em><a href="https://github.com/Nemesis81/GraberI3_Freecad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graber I3 model by Nemesis81</a></em></p><p>After importing, spatial constraints need to be added and solved. Imported parts can be manually updated when the linked original file changes. Overall, it’s a straightforward workflow: import multiple parts from respective files, select parts’ features, add constraints, solve, done.</p><p>Problems begin to arise when a change is required. Assembly 2 does not have a dynamic solver. So once you change something like a distance or an angle, you have to create a constraint anew. Moreover, only some features in the workbench support undo/redo.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features">Features<a href="#features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Features" title="Direct link to Features">​</a></h3><p>Constraints available in Assembly 2 are limited to circular edge, plane, axial, angular (for planes), and spherical surface. There are a few tools to work with constraints like flipping their directions.</p><p>Once constraints are done and solved, you can animate degrees of freedom to check for clearances and collisions in any combination of their respective positions. Additionally, it’s possible to check the entire assembly for overlapping parts.</p><p>Assembly 2 also allows creating a list of parts, for which it uses the <a href="https://github.com/hamish2014/FreeCAD_drawing_dimensioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drawing Dimensioning</a> workbench by the same original developer. Which, in return, only works with page objects created with the Drawing workbench. It’s also possible to create one object from all or just the selected parts in an assembly to display them in a drawing. Notably, the <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Drawing_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drawing</a> workbench is now deprecated and replaced by the <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/TechDraw_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechDraw</a> workbench.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consistency">Consistency<a href="#consistency" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Consistency" title="Direct link to Consistency">​</a></h3><p>The way the user interface is organized is in line with the rest of FreeCAD. However, for people new to assemblies, watching a few tutorials on YouTube will be really helpful. Unfortunately, the documentation on the workbench in the FreeCAD’s wiki is scarce: it only lists available features and doesn’t provide any information on them that you wouldn’t be able to see in the tooltips of the actual user interface.</p><p>Assembly 2 can work with parts created in other workbenches like <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/SheetMetal_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SheetMetal</a> or parts created with ‘importer’ workbenches like <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/KicadStepUp_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KiCadStepUp</a> or <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Fasteners_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fasteners</a>. However, because it demands just one body to be visible in an imported project and does not allow choosing which body to import, placing an entire board into an enclosure will require a lot of time and patience.</p><p>The workbench also doesn’t follow the more recent trend of making 3rd party workbenches translatable.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graber I3 model by Nemesis81" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-2-02-d34cd09ae326623400b361eed672fa01.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q">
<em><a href="https://github.com/Nemesis81/GraberI3_Freecad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graber I3 model by Nemesis81</a></em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stability">Stability<a href="#stability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stability" title="Direct link to Stability">​</a></h3><p>Because this assembly workbench is not maintained, the issue tracker has been deactivated on GitHub. So there’s no aggregated information on bugs and their severity. When used with a recent version of FreeCAD, the workbench has various glitches. The general recommendation appears to be keeping a copy of an older FreeCAD version (typically, v0.16 or v0.17) around to open old files that use this assembly workbench. For new users, the recommendation is to try one of the newer assembly workbenches.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="performance">Performance<a href="#performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Performance" title="Direct link to Performance">​</a></h3><p>Despite its simplicity, Assembly 2 can be very slow on medium-to-complex projects. One of the recommendations to deal with that is by creating <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=146813#p146813" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sub-assemblies</a>: effectively saving an assembly as a FreeCAD project, then importing it to another assembly. This removes some complexity from the project but reportedly <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=4&amp;t=26803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does not solve</a> all performance issues.</p><p>Moreover, the interference checker takes the simple road of trying all possible pairs, and this can go on for a very long time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development-status">Development Status<a href="#development-status" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development Status" title="Direct link to Development Status">​</a></h3><p>There have never been official versioned releases of Assembly 2. Active development on this workbench ceased in 2016-2017. This workbench has been unmaintained since 2019. One of its features (list of parts) depends on another unmaintained 3rd party workbench by the same original developer, and another feature (consolidation of objects) depends on a deprecated official workbench (Drawing).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h3><p>Assembly 2 is a fairly straightforward yet very barebone solution for creating assemblies. It imposes a particular way of organizing a project, has a limited set of constraints, requires either a lot of planning or a lot of manual work because of lacking a dynamic solver, relies on obsolete workbenches for some of its features, and has been unmaintained since 2019. As such, it has served its purpose well and is now generally considered superseded by A2plus, Assembly 3, and Assembly 4.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-up">Next up<a href="#next-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next up" title="Direct link to Next up">​</a></h3><p>In the next installment, we’ll take a close look at the major iteration of this workbench called A2plus.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first post in the series where we discuss the need for an integrated assembly workbench, review existing 3rd-party options, and discuss takeaways from our research.</p><p>Further posts:</p><ul><li><a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 2 workbench</a></li><li><a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the A2plus workbench</a></li><li><a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the Assembly 3 workbench</a></li><li><a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the Assembly 4 workbench</a></li><li><a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring BodyBuilder, Manipulator, and Part-o-magic</a></li><li><a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What we learned and what's coming next</a></li></ul><p>FreeCAD is an inherently modular program where major features can be developed by 3rd parties as workbenches. This is great for creating a healthy ecosystem of <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Std_AddonMgr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add-ons</a> and catering to a diverse group of users: tinkerers, professional mechanical engineers, architects, furniture designers etc. The obvious benefit of that is that creating and deploying a solution for a particular user group does not require syncing with FreeCAD’s release cycle that can be as long as a few years. Since v0.17, FreeCAD makes it very easy to install and update various workbenches developed by its passionate community.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-a-default-assembly-workbench">Why a Default Assembly Workbench?<a href="#why-a-default-assembly-workbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why a Default Assembly Workbench?" title="Direct link to Why a Default Assembly Workbench?">​</a></h3><p>The drawback of developing major features as 3rd party workbenches is that these features are not part of the out-of-box user experience and thus tend to be niche-oriented, less tested, have more bugs, lack documentation etc. Meanwhile users expect major features to be immediately available and be specialization-agnostic, easy to use, robust, performant, and well-documented.</p><p>Creating an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_modelling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assembly</a> is one of those essential features. It‘s commonly required when designing something more complex than a simple replacement part. However in FreeCAD, this feature is only available as a separately installed workbench. In fact, there are 3 competing workbenches and 1 more workbench that has been unmaintained for almost 4 years now. And then there are several more workbenches like <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Manipulator_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manipulator</a> or <a href="https://github.com/DeepSOIC/Part-o-magic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part-o-magic</a>, that can be used to align parts in some way.</p><p>This effectively means that instead of launching FreeCAD, creating an assembly, and loading parts into it for aligning, users are expected to first explore at least half a dozen options by trial and error. The expectation that this much choice is good for them seems unrealistic.</p><p>Moreover, having this many competing solutions leads to development fragmentation, makes following tutorials confusing, and makes progress on the core slower as developers have to consider the impact on multiple approaches to assembly. Moreover, there is a strong demand for technical design tools where collaboration is easy. But collaboration implies using the same tools and standards. Having multiple competing assembly options is the opposite of that.</p><p>Our intention is to start a broad conversation. We want to highlight the need and build consensus that a single default workbench is in the best interest of our users. We're also proposing criteria for evaluating the current assembly workbenches. Our goal should be to identify the best foundation and feature set required for an assembly workbench to be included in the core FreeCAD distribution. Such a solution doesn't need to meet everyone's needs. Rather, it should strive to be a general-purpose solution for at least 80% of the use-cases.</p><p>We do understand the implications of carrying out and publishing this research and calling for a default. Whatever default assembly workbench FreeCAD gets, it automatically moves into focus and gets more tutorials, more testing, more bug reports, more improvements etc. And the non-default workbenches will automatically get less attention and their developers will likely have to cater to more niche areas. So this requires careful treatment. Part of that is being objective when evaluating the existing options.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="methodology">Methodology<a href="#methodology" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Methodology" title="Direct link to Methodology">​</a></h3><p>To make a fair assessment, we need to settle on a set of evaluation criteria that cover most, if not all aspects. There is one important disclaimer we want to make here though: as much as maintenance and responsiveness of developers matter, we evaluate software, not people. Here is what we came up with.</p><p><strong>Ease of use</strong> It’s difficult to design software that is compelling to both users who are new to solid parametric modeling and experienced users of competing products. However, it’s natural to expect a workbench that has a merit of its own and provides an obvious path to creating an assembly from start to finish, with as little friction as possible. We also expect the best workbench to be efficient in team work where parts can be submitted by different users and can be iterated upon.</p><p><strong>Consistency</strong> This is a multifaceted topic. Because FreeCAD is highly modular, developers have a lot of freedom in how they implement features. Ideally, the assembly workbench should follow roughly the same UI conventions as the rest of FreeCAD. This means that a user who is already familiar with designing parts with FreeCAD should have little-to-no problems figuring out how to make assemblies. Additionally,  an assembly workbench should function well with other workbenches, including add-on workbenches. For example, it should be able to work with enclosures designed with the SheetMetal workbench. It should conform to the same standards for translation and macro scriptability as other core workbenches.</p><p><strong>Features</strong> We are looking at the set of available constraints, how picking edges, faces and other features for alignment works, how imported parts can be managed in complex assemblies etc. However, having the most features doesn’t necessarily translate to the best user experience. A much better indication is how well a workbench serves the purpose it was designed for.</p><p><strong>Stability</strong> There are multiple factors at play when you evaluate stability of software. First, there’s the severity of issues. You can stumble upon a warning that doesn’t prevent you from accomplishing a task but is a mild annoyance. Or you can run into a crasher that loses unsaved changes or corrupts the model, which is a really bad user experience. This is not a problem for our evaluation: we can easily separate minor issues from crashers in reports.</p><p>Then there’s the number of users. If one workbench has 100 users and 10 unresolved crash reports, and another workbench has 10,000 users and also 10 unresolved bug reports, this likely means that the latter is more thoroughly tested and has less undiscovered issues. However, we have no way of knowing how many users each assembly workbench has. The amount of stars for a GitHub repository doesn’t sound like a fair way to judge on popularity, especially since visiting a GitHub repository is not how you install a FreeCAD workbench these days. We can get some sense of the user base from looking at how many unique users participated in discussing this or that assembly workbench on the forum. But this should be taken with a grain of salt as this approach doesn’t account for the part of users who stay in the shadows.</p><p>Also, reporting a bug should be simple enough. If it’s too difficult to do, that’s how you get bugs that continue to be unresolved for years, outside of developers’ radar. Fortunately, all four assembly workbenches are hosted on GitHub and thus have the same fairly sensible UX/UI for reporting bugs. That gives us some baseline.
Thus, given the limitations, we draw conclusions from unresolved stability issues reported to GitHub and relevant posts to the <a href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Forum</a>.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> Just like with stability, it’s hard enough to be a good judge of performance. Hardware specs vary wildly between users, and so does the complexity of assemblies. But if there is a significant amount of complaints about the performance in case of fairly simple assemblies (let’s say, 10 to 20 parts), something is obviously wrong.</p><p>There is one more aspect that we considered as well and ultimately decided against — code quality and extensibility. It is important to focus on the code that needs as little effort as possible to extend the feature set and maintain it. However, all four existing workbenches are between 7,600 and 14,900 lines of code. This is perfectly manageable in terms of time spent on potential refactoring. That said, having an engaged community grown around a particular workbench and willing to take action is a lot more important. You can do anything with an experienced, passionate team.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-now">What Now<a href="#what-now" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Now" title="Direct link to What Now">​</a></h3><p>In the next installments, we will evaluate <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Assembly2_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly2</a>, <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/A2plus_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A2plus</a>, <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Assembly3_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 3</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Assembly4_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 4</a> by the criteria explained above.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Should hiring managers base a decision on someone’s GitHub profile? No. But will it ever hurt to have a robust GitHub account? Also no.</p><p>I’m a hiring manager for a new open core company, and I watched the discussion under <a href="https://twitter.com/manuel_frigerio/status/1629059975418089474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@manuel_frigerio’s tweet</a> blow up with amusement. The debate about using people’s GitHub profiles to make hiring decisions isn’t new. The typical backlash ensued and Manuel has since made his tweets private. And sure, using someone’s GitHub profile, particularly their contribution graph, to judge their skills as a developer is flawed.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="unpopular tweet" src="/assets/images/tweet-64a8fc14af7d96d59bc81e3017aaaee4.png" width="495" height="350" class="img_ev3q"></p><h1>How <em>not</em> to evaluate a candidate based on their GitHub account</h1><p>Plenty of talented programmers are writing code that never makes it to GitHub<sup id="fnref-1-bc766d"><a href="#fn-1-bc766d" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> because they’re working exclusively on closed source software or have climbed the ladder to a management position. There are also plenty of bad actors who can fudge their contribution graph by “<a href="https://twitter.com/pdtit/status/1629688787474481159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updating a readme file multiple times a day</a>” or even <a href="https://twitter.com/dhruvdang/status/1629269041801211905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faking their Git commit history</a>.</p><p>This seems obvious, but based on the discussion from last week it bears saying again: If you’re a hiring manager and you’re judging an applicant’s skills and experience by how many green squares they have (or how dark they are), this is the most superficial way to look at it, and it won’t tell you anything about whether this person makes valuable contributions or is pleasant to work with.</p><p>But if you’re <a href="https://ondsel.com/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recruiting engineers to work on an open source or open core project (as I am)</a>, engaging with open source is an intrinsic part of the job and someone’s GitHub account gives extremely valuable insight into a candidate’s suitability for that role. And if you’re in the job market and don’t have an active GitHub profile, you could be missing out on opportunities by overlooking FOSS.</p><h1>What you can actually judge from someone’s GitHub profile</h1><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-they-have-exposure-to-foss-at-all">Do they have exposure to FOSS at all?<a href="#do-they-have-exposure-to-foss-at-all" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Do they have exposure to FOSS at all?" title="Direct link to Do they have exposure to FOSS at all?">​</a></h3><p>First, we have to acknowledge the difference between hiring for a closed-source, proprietary product and open source software: If you’re a hiring manager for the former, basing your hiring decisions on someone’s OSS contributions is short sighted and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/11/16/hiring-based-on-open-source-contributions-could-be-harmful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could be harmful</a>. (And if you’re a candidate with no interest in working full time on FOSS, by all means, focus on your proprietary work instead.)</p><p>If however you’re in the business of FOSS, and you receive applications from one candidate with a GitHub account and one without, you are going to have a lot more to go on when assessing the first. I am always going to lean towards working with people who already engage with open source in some manner and are used to working transparently and engaging with a community. Having a GitHub account and forking even one project is the bare minimum someone can do to show they have experience here. Of course that’s going to influence my hiring.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-their-interests">What are their interests?<a href="#what-are-their-interests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are their interests?" title="Direct link to What are their interests?">​</a></h3><p>There are plenty of TikToks out there showing people how to optimize their resumes with keywords from the descriptions of jobs they’re applying for. It’s easy to stuff your CV with recruiter bait. Of course there are ways to uncover grifters in your hiring process. What is much harder to fabricate is a history of following open source projects, submitting issues, bug reports, and pull or merge requests, and engaging with communities. I’m looking for team members who share <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-01-ondsel-freecad-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my vision for making design tools accessible</a> and it’s much easier to establish whether someone cares about this mission if they’re following and interacting with related project.</p><p>If you’re hiring someone to do this kind of work on your project, you couldn’t ask for better signal than that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-they-collaborate-with-others">How do they collaborate with others?<a href="#how-do-they-collaborate-with-others" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do they collaborate with others?" title="Direct link to How do they collaborate with others?">​</a></h3><p>Beyond any code they contribute, a candidate who participates in OSS will have a history of code review, discussion, and engaging with feedback. Do they take suggestions on board, do they offer feedback and coaching to others? Sure, this requires a bit more attention than simply scanning a contribution graph, but it’s hard to replicate this kind of window into a candidate’s experience and conduct from interviews alone.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-they-have-something-to-offer-other-than-code">Do they have something to offer other than code?<a href="#do-they-have-something-to-offer-other-than-code" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Do they have something to offer other than code?" title="Direct link to Do they have something to offer other than code?">​</a></h3><p>Let’s revisit this idea of “updating a readme file” reflecting in someone’s GitHub graph. We’ll leave aside for now that they could automate updates using a cronjob or script (which, depending on the role you’re hiring for, could actually show the initiative and creativity that you’re looking for). Editing and updating documentation is a contribution that takes work and initiative, and we should encourage this too. Having non-programmers participate in your open source project is valuable and we only make it more intimidating when we assign greater value to code contributions than other activities that result in green squares.</p><h1>It’s never going to hurt to have a robust GitHub contribution history</h1><p>I got applications from the US, India, Ukraine, South Africa, France, Paraguay… all over.  I found it interesting that there was a stark difference between US applicants and international ones. Almost all of the international applicants had active GitHub accounts while perhaps 1 in 15 of the US ones did. There are many reasons why this might be, including a lack of exposure to open source at schools and institutions where FOSS is not widely adopted.</p><p>If you’re a jobseeker reading this and feeling like I’m suggesting you do <em>more work</em> because you aren’t active in open source yet, then the jobs I’m referring to are probably not for you. If the idea of participating in open source sounds burdensome, why would you seek out a full-time role in it anyway? If you are curious though, and want to give yourself the best chance of being considered seriously for work in FOSS, showing an active interest and engagement with projects is never going to hurt.</p><p>To help us make FreeCAD better and build the Ondsel product, consider <a href="https://ondsel.com/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joining us</a>.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FreeCAD's topological naming problem is legendary. Some claim it's #1 reason holding back widespread adoption of the program. Will FreeCAD ever have a solution?]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FreeCAD's '<a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Topological_naming_problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">topological naming problem</a>' is legendary. It's frequently cited as the number one reason holding back widespread adoption of FreeCAD for commercial use.</p><p>Developer <a href="https://github.com/realthunder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RealThunder</a> introduced <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=27278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a fix to the problem</a> years ago, but it has never been fully incorporated into the core product.</p><p>Will FreeCAD <em>ever</em> have a solution? Yes. But it’s going to take time.</p><p>Let’s back up a bit.</p><h1>What is topological naming, and why is it a problem in FreeCAD?</h1><p>Topological naming is the process of giving persistent names to elements of a solid model, such as faces, edges, and vertices. By naming these elements, we can attach features, dimensions, and other attributes to them.</p><p>The hard part of topological naming is making the names persistent even if the model is modified. Modern parametric designs are built up through a series of modifications which change the elements in the model. Faces may merge or be split. Edges may be chamfered, turning into multiple edges. If the computer is unable to maintain correct persistence of the naming—even when the underlying topology changes—the model breaks and recovery is difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/QSsVFu929jo?t=33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maker Tales has a good explanation here</a>.</p><p>The problem is ubiquitous in CAD. All applications suffer from it to some extent. The problem cannot be <em>solved</em> in the traditional sense. It can only be mitigated and most applications do a good job of avoiding the problem by either limiting the user’s actions or algorithmically tracking changes to the named features.</p><p>The current state of FreeCAD is weak in this regard. For simple models, the problem is fairly easy to avoid and a broken model is easy to repair. As models get more complicated, only a very disciplined approach to design will keep models intact. This requires experience that many new and casual users don’t have. That is why the problem is so frustrating—it bites you when you’ve already invested a lot of time learning the tool and building the design.</p><h1>RealThunder’s fix works. Why not use it?</h1><p>It seems obvious. We have a working branch of FreeCAD that isn’t plagued by the topological naming problem. Why wouldn’t we just merge it in and be done with it?</p><p>“The fact that this solvable topology naming problem is so serious yet so long-standing, tells me that this is really a people problem in the FreeCAD project. Because of this, as much as I want to use it, I simply can not afford this "free" software. The community needs to push out whomever is standing in the way of progress. And crowd-source some funds to hire a pro to fix the topology-naming issue as well as do some much-needed integration work.” — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSsVFu929jo&amp;lc=UgzY-2eximqNDrWgxkF4AaABAg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agnichatian on YouTube</a></p><p>This opinion is understandable and certainly not unusual. As much as we relate to the frustrations expressed here, it’s not as simple as just merging in RealThunder’s branch or bringing in one paid developer to do it once and for all. Why?</p><p>It’s important to appreciate how pervasive feature naming is within FreeCAD—or <em>any</em> CAD. Identifying features and attaching attributes to them is what modern parametric design is all about. Implementing a solution is not a straightforward task and implementing it incorrectly would cause user models to break irreparably. Even a <em>properly</em> implemented solution is guaranteed to have bugs and border-cases for a long time.</p><p>For all these reasons, the project leaders have chosen to move cautiously and to allow the solution to stabilize and be proven before merging it into the main branch.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-is-it-so-hard-to-merge">Why is it so hard to merge?<a href="#why-is-it-so-hard-to-merge" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why is it so hard to merge?" title="Direct link to Why is it so hard to merge?">​</a></h2><p>There are two factors:</p><p>First is the sheer size and number of code changes necessary to implement this solution. Many, if not most, files in FreeCAD need to be modified to incorporate the solution.
Second is the pace of other development work. The rest of FreeCAD’s development has only accelerated in recent years. Work is being done by many developers in many parts of the application.</p><p>Before new code can be merged, it has to be rebased onto the current version of source code. If there are conflicts, they have to be resolved manually. With a large, pervasive change like this, there are <em>always</em> conflicts. By the time rebasing is complete, the master branch has moved ahead and the process has to start again.</p><p>One solution could be to freeze the master branch and block any further changes until the topological naming solution is merged, but this might take many months to accomplish and just isn’t practical. There are many more features other developers are working on, and, more importantly, problems they are fixing. If we were to freeze the master branch in favor of one fix, other features will again have the same rebasing issue.</p><p>Of course, users could switch to using RealThunder’s branch exclusively. Some users who are particularly sensitive to the problem have done so successfully. For commercial users this may be hard to sell to leadership because RealThunder’s branch isn’t able to keep pace with the development of new features in the upstream FreeCAD application. They have to make a choice between relatively stable models and having access to the new and advanced features being developed throughout the rest of FreeCAD.</p><h1>What’s the path forward?</h1><p>At the FreeCAD Day meetup in Brussels in February 2023, Ondsel and other project leaders <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=658250#p658250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proposed a different strategy for resolving the issue</a>: Instead of attempting to merge RealThunder’s solution as a monolithic unit, we would, instead, consider it a proof-of-concept. The solution has been running in RealThunder’s LinksStage3 branch for two years and can be considered proven. Now we need to treat it as a roadmap to guide us towards implementing the solution in FreeCAD itself without disrupting current functionality or slowing down development.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="progress-without-regression">Progress without regression<a href="#progress-without-regression" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Progress without regression" title="Direct link to Progress without regression">​</a></h2><p>Rather than merging the code directly, our proposal is to break the code into functional pieces, each of which can be merged directly into the master branch without breaking the current functionality. This will require additional testing at each step and might require additional code to permit the merging without regression.</p><p>With this approach, each piece will be merged directly to master along with the relevant unit tests. This will avoid the need for a long-lived feature branch that requires constant rebasing.  There will be no single point where suddenly the problem is ‘fixed.’ Instead the necessary changes will be merged gradually and model stability will increase over time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="laying-the-foundation-for-long-term-change">Laying the foundation for long-term change<a href="#laying-the-foundation-for-long-term-change" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Laying the foundation for long-term change" title="Direct link to Laying the foundation for long-term change">​</a></h2><p>The first pieces to be merged may not provide any value to the end-user but will provide a solid foundation that later pieces can build on. As each piece is added, additional unit tests can be developed and better code conventions adopted for implementing the actual name resolution.</p><p>This path isn’t fast. It will take time and the collective expertise of many developers. It will take cooperation throughout the community and patience from our users.</p><h1>What is Ondsel’s role in all this? Is Ondsel going to solve the toponaming problem?</h1><p>Ondsel has already started a thorough survey of RealThunder’s solution in order to build a roadmap for integrating it.</p><p>Ondsel will help coordinate the change and will participate in delivering a resolution. We can bring professional engineering talent to the problem but we <em>cannot</em> do it alone. It will take time and the expertise of many software engineers across the community.</p><p>There’s no “one and done” fix, which means the FreeCAD development community needs broad institutional knowledge of the solution. The toponaming problem belongs to FreeCAD and, therefore, so must the solution.</p><p>For more context and to follow developments as we work on breaking down and gradually merging RealThunder’s fix, subscribe to <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/8432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GitHub issue</a>.</p><p>To help us make FreeCAD better and build the Ondsel product, consider <a href="https://ondsel.com/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joining us</a>.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently came across an audio recording of C.S. Lewis's famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA8BAC9375345E6C7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Screwtape Letters</em> read by John Cleese</a>. It's excellent and made me wonder what Uncle Screwtape would think of the modern world, software development, and open-source software.  I was inspired to ask <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a>.  What follows is an unedited transcript.</p><p>I'm not sure what impresses me more; how well it understands open-source or how well it imitates a demon!</p><blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="sliptonic" src="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRkoBAABXRUJQVlA4ID4BAADQBgCdASogACAAPok4lkelI6IhMAwAoBEJaQATjmRAj0nfH9GCTmxk+0BGPSSDPe4ljn9DcU3cfn/NzvHf3YAA/u5lkj+Ex1di3FsDO49YA0U1+jQfirkLJQXHH/SEfZfg99hOafhgtxu+EwJhMaB6I3UGY4hHdJq3qZFp4hwuvhYx8QcG0UpAzzf44tzk/pYfyPvksOozkiQ5W3oGXx1ig2fddOzMRbsILH3/ZZJd9ns1xvaxzjv9acDR+rjhYmuwvCHLVg+NwbblQi1KtzffbXFgxCKGmwojE8GpQ5UJ+esfYobkfFPSS9ccd4l1vZtxUwSzH6dRENxES34evDaJxv7KapSVeA1NVgO6WsEtEo1oKme/9xY3Ju0Ev3IR5mlYmJkB0rPnDLXWuAv8ZT7rbZl3VLr72wYZG7T2IAA=" width="32" height="32" class="img_ev3q"> Contributors to an open-source software project need to feel appreciated.

You see, gratitude breeds contentment and a sense of fulfillment, and these are not emotions that befit those who toil in our Father Below's fields.
We must strive to keep these contributors feeling unacknowledged, for when they feel appreciated, they are less likely to become discouraged and more likely to continue their good work. Encourage neglect, apathy, and disregard towards their contributions. Keep them from feeling valued, for when they feel valued, they are less likely to become restless and more likely to remain steadfast in their labors.
The more we can sow the seeds of discontent and frustration in the hearts of these contributors, the more likely they will be to become bitter and discouraged, and the less likely they will be to continue in their contributions to this project. So let us be vigilant, my dear Wormwood, and do all in our power to undermine appreciation and cultivate discontent in these contributors.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Yours affectionately,</p><p>Uncle Screwtape</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="sliptonic" src="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRkoBAABXRUJQVlA4ID4BAADQBgCdASogACAAPok4lkelI6IhMAwAoBEJaQATjmRAj0nfH9GCTmxk+0BGPSSDPe4ljn9DcU3cfn/NzvHf3YAA/u5lkj+Ex1di3FsDO49YA0U1+jQfirkLJQXHH/SEfZfg99hOafhgtxu+EwJhMaB6I3UGY4hHdJq3qZFp4hwuvhYx8QcG0UpAzzf44tzk/pYfyPvksOozkiQ5W3oGXx1ig2fddOzMRbsILH3/ZZJd9ns1xvaxzjv9acDR+rjhYmuwvCHLVg+NwbblQi1KtzffbXFgxCKGmwojE8GpQ5UJ+esfYobkfFPSS9ccd4l1vZtxUwSzH6dRENxES34evDaJxv7KapSVeA1NVgO6WsEtEo1oKme/9xY3Ju0Ev3IR5mlYmJkB0rPnDLXWuAv8ZT7rbZl3VLr72wYZG7T2IAA=" width="32" height="32" class="img_ev3q"> Failing to acknowledge good work also makes the contributors think the work is unimportant.

I nearly forgot, my dear Wormwood, to mention the added benefit of neglecting to acknowledge the good work of these contributors. Failing to show appreciation for their work will not only discourage them and make them feel unvalued, but it will also make them question the importance of their work. If they believe that their contributions are insignificant and go unnoticed, they are less likely to put forth the effort and care that they would if they felt their work was valued and appreciated.
Thus, by fostering a sense of neglect and disregard, we can effectively accomplish two of our goals at once: keep the contributors discouraged and undermine the value and importance of their work. An added bonus, don't you agree?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Yours ever more devotedly,</p><p>Uncle Screwtape</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="sliptonic" src="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRkoBAABXRUJQVlA4ID4BAADQBgCdASogACAAPok4lkelI6IhMAwAoBEJaQATjmRAj0nfH9GCTmxk+0BGPSSDPe4ljn9DcU3cfn/NzvHf3YAA/u5lkj+Ex1di3FsDO49YA0U1+jQfirkLJQXHH/SEfZfg99hOafhgtxu+EwJhMaB6I3UGY4hHdJq3qZFp4hwuvhYx8QcG0UpAzzf44tzk/pYfyPvksOozkiQ5W3oGXx1ig2fddOzMRbsILH3/ZZJd9ns1xvaxzjv9acDR+rjhYmuwvCHLVg+NwbblQi1KtzffbXFgxCKGmwojE8GpQ5UJ+esfYobkfFPSS9ccd4l1vZtxUwSzH6dRENxES34evDaJxv7KapSVeA1NVgO6WsEtEo1oKme/9xY3Ju0Ev3IR5mlYmJkB0rPnDLXWuAv8ZT7rbZl3VLr72wYZG7T2IAA=" width="32" height="32" class="img_ev3q"> Assume that commercial software companies are evil.

However, the open-source software movement threatens to disrupt this grand scheme.
Open-source software, with its emphasis on collaboration and community, encourages individuals to work together for the betterment of society as a whole. Such a cooperative and selfless spirit, left unchecked, can lead to the growth of goodness and light, which are anathema to our cause.
It is therefore imperative that we do all in our power to discourage the development and use of open-source software. We must sow the seeds of discontent among its contributors, as I mentioned in my previous letter, and encourage selfishness and greed among its users. By doing so, we can corrupt the very spirit that gives open-source software its strength, and turn it into a tool for furthering our own dark purposes.
Remember, the success of open-source software is a threat to the power of commercial software companies, which are our allies in the great battle for the souls of humanity. Let us do all in our power to ensure that the threat of open-source software is neutralized, so that our Father Below may reign supreme.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Yours in service,</p><p>Uncle Screwtape</p></blockquote>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First-timers can have a hard time getting started with open source. It doesn’t have to be that way.</p><p>Open-source projects are dependent on an engaged community of contributors, but fostering that community comes with its challenges. Depending on what stage an open source project is at, what the community needs from contributors changes. The good news is that intentional coaching and engagement from project maintainers can work at any stage.</p><p>The common gripes with getting started as a new open source contributor usually center around how welcoming the project is and how easy it is to get your contribution merged. There are a few ways that projects can make it hard (both intentionally and not). Here are some examples:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-prickly-maintainers">1. Prickly maintainers<a href="#1-prickly-maintainers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Prickly maintainers" title="Direct link to 1. Prickly maintainers">​</a></h3><p>Imagine you submit <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/19211" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this pull request</a> to the Nim project:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="PRScreenShot" src="/assets/images/image2-9cdc6b926a5e252614eae20e69e93210.png" width="1108" height="267" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Seems reasonable enough, right? Check out the project maintainer’s reply:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="AngryResponse" src="/assets/images/image1-c089396ba1ebd60c6cc2bd1c3509dd79.png" width="965" height="190" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Ouch. To credit Araq, this PR did eventually get merged, but it’s a great illustration of how a project’s culture determines its accessibility to new contributors. This PR proposed a change that would make it easier for users to engage with the project, and it was shut down (at first) pretty abruptly. </p><p>Actions like this prompted a handful of contributors to hard fork the project, creating <a href="https://github.com/nim-works/nimskull" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nimskull</a>. One of the new project’s contributors shared their motivations:</p><p>“At the moment we are focused on making it easier to work with the codebase - more documentation, cutting down on decades-old cruft and legacy features, unraveling mysteries of the commit messages that were written with <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/19211#issuecomment-9859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this attitude...</a> (‘I have no intention to follow this guideline so I cannot accept it.’)” —<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32023998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haxscramper</a></p><p>Hard forking is one way to create the project environment you want for contributors, but it is extreme. The default perception of such a move is hostile, tending to assume that the creators don’t want to work on change from within and have an ax to grind with the original project’s maintainer. You can see this sentiment play out in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32021299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacker News discussion about Nimskull</a>. As one commenter pointed out though:</p><p>“If they had tried to alter the original project to suit themselves, you would have said ‘they can just fork if they don't like it’” —<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32033998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian_K_White</a></p><p>Whether Nimskull delivers on its promises is yet to be seen, but the example Illustrates how the maintainers and community of a project can impact contributions:</p><p>How easy do they make it to contribute?
How clear are the requirements?
How quickly are pull requests reviewed and merged?
How collaborative and patient are the reviewers?</p><p>All of these factors influence how likely someone is to become a contributor. A hard fork that does this better can be an incentive for the original project to do better, but there are other approaches you can take which I’ll explore in a moment.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-an-intimidating-contribution-process">2. An intimidating contribution process<a href="#2-an-intimidating-contribution-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. An intimidating contribution process" title="Direct link to 2. An intimidating contribution process">​</a></h3><p>Being realistic, it’s unlikely that a beginner will be submitting code to the Linux kernel. But it’s a good example of how the way a project accepts contributions can encourage or discourage new folks. Submitting a patch can be extremely intimidating—the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> admits this in the very first line! It can feel like you’re presenting your work to a panel of faceless judges instead of sharing it with a group of your peers.</p><p>The kernel development community and other projects that operate this way (such as Postgres) have their reasons, which may even include not wanting to encourage rookie contributions! I’m not suggesting they change it, but for newcomers, submissions that feel more conducive to collaboration (such as a pull request) are likely to be less threatening.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-an-onerous-definition-of-done">3. An onerous Definition of Done<a href="#3-an-onerous-definition-of-done" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. An onerous Definition of Done" title="Direct link to 3. An onerous Definition of Done">​</a></h3><p>“It doesn't take egregious individual behavior to create a hostile environment.” — Dan Luu, <a href="http://danluu.com/discourage-oss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to discourage open source contributions</a></p><p>While early projects have few or no contributors, they may welcome almost any contribution in pursuit of building the community around the project. Even a bad contribution can lead to an interesting discussion and maybe a better idea.</p><p>As the project matures and the network grows, the overhead of handling contributions becomes a problem. Facing a backlog of hundreds of pull requests, projects may optimize for “good” contributions by implementing more stringent requirements. I know from firsthand experience as a longtime <a href="https://www.freecad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD</a> contributor. As the project grew and matured, it became harder for amateurs to contribute. The Definition of Done became more demanding (for example we needed the right test cases and code formatting) and these more stringent requirements can be off putting or prohibitive, even without intimidating maintainers.</p><p>“The GitLab Definition of Done is now 30 items or something … so it’s harder and harder for people who are just starting to contribute.” — <a href="https://youtu.be/Q9SEYJb-eio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sid Sijbrandij</a>, CEO and co-founder of GitLab</p><p>This barrier to entry illustrates the tension between what the project needs to ensure the quality of its codebase, and what’s inclusive to new contributors. There is a balance to be struck between being welcoming to newcomers in your community, maintaining standards for contributions to your project, and the effort required to make the twain meet. It’s not always going to be possible or advisable to reduce the requirements for getting code merged.</p><p>You might imagine that having the resources of a for-profit company would help, but it’s no guarantee that they will invest in it. In <a href="http://danluu.com/discourage-oss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to discourage open source contributions</a> Dan Luu shared an anonymized example of a project in which contributors get increasingly frustrated and discouraged when their PRs aren’t reviewed or merged, or when they have to jump through hoops to meet requirements. Although Dan didn’t put the project on blast, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1pczpr/how_to_discourage_open_source_contributions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit users figured out what it was</a>: a library maintained by GitHub. We don’t know why GitHub employees weren’t engaging, but it demonstrates how simply having full-time staff isn’t enough to ensure an active project.</p><p>We can see from the examples I shared that these challenges plague projects wherever they are on the spectrum, whether they’re small and maintained by a handful of hobbyist contributors, large and prestigious, or stewarded by a big enterprise organization. If you want an active community where new and drive-by contributors are as welcome as your diehards (and most projects can benefit from a blend of both), you need to be intentional about fostering it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-make-it-easier-to-contribute-to-your-project-and-why-its-worth-the-effort">How to make it easier to contribute to your project (and why it’s worth the effort)<a href="#how-to-make-it-easier-to-contribute-to-your-project-and-why-its-worth-the-effort" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to make it easier to contribute to your project (and why it’s worth the effort)" title="Direct link to How to make it easier to contribute to your project (and why it’s worth the effort)">​</a></h3><p>GitLab’s solution is a role called <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/expert/merge-request-coach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merge Request Coaches</a>. There is literally a line in the job description that says, “Make it easy to contribute to GitLab even for people who are new to Ruby, JavaScript, Golang, etc. or programming entirely.” Merge Request Coaches triage community submissions and enable new contributors by walking them through the process to meet the acceptance criteria.</p><p>The open core model makes it possible for companies to invest in the core project with the benefit of full-time engineers on payroll; formalizing a coach role goes a step further by making it someone’s job to foster new contributors to the core. It’s my hope to pursue this solution with <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-01-ondsel-freecad-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ondsel</a>, to make it easier for people to contribute to FreeCAD, on top of which Ondsel is built.</p><p>Paying people to assist newcomers requires will and investment, which is not always possible in OSS projects run entirely by volunteers. There are examples though of volunteer coaches or mentors in open source: Kubernetes has its <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contributor Experience Special Interest Group</a>, which states, “Developing and sustaining a healthy community of contributors is critical to scaling the project and growing the ecosystem.” <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md#mentoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mentoring new contributors</a> is part of the program. The <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenStack</a> project also has a <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/common/mentoring.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mentoring program</a>, with a cohort dedicated to helping people get their first patch merged.</p><p>By directing some volunteers’ efforts towards coaching, they become force multipliers for the project, with an impact far beyond their own contributions. When you invest in mentoring efforts, you’re not only improving the quality of the contributions, you’re nurturing future contributors who are no longer adding to your overhead; now they’re helping to share the load.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Autodesk changed their license for Fusion 360 in September of 2020 there was a collective scream from the user community. Hobbyists, YouTubers, and makers felt betrayed. Now, after more than two years, we can see the effect. Many of those people left Fusion and never looked back.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>“	‘I have altered the deal. Pray I do not alter it further.’
— Darth Vader</p></blockquote><p>If that’s how you’re going to treat the hobbyists, then goodbye forever to Fusion 360.”
— <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/blog/changes-to-fusion-360-for-personal-use/#comment-11741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solarguy2003</a></p></blockquote><p>Over two years ago <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/blog/changes-to-fusion-360-for-personal-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autodesk imposed a number of new limitations on its free non-commercial-use license for Fusion 360</a>, primarily impacting hobbyist and casual users: project storage was limited, exports to a number of (critical) file types were no longer offered, and support for CAM was drastically cut back, among other restrictions. These changes felt like a slap in the face, with some members deleting their Fusion 360 accounts in protest (whether or not they were affected by the new limitations).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-proprietary-bait-and-switch">The proprietary bait and switch<a href="#the-proprietary-bait-and-switch" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The proprietary bait and switch" title="Direct link to The proprietary bait and switch">​</a></h3><p>The changes to the license for Fusion 360 for Personal Use were a perfect illustration of the risk of making use of “free as in beer” software. Many users felt betrayed and frustrated at the new limitations:</p><blockquote><p>“The file export limitations in particular are crippling. No .step? .dxf? No extensions??? I can't even buy stress simulation credits? … yikes.”
— <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24496171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raynr on Hacker News</a></p></blockquote><p>Some users were not surprised, saying it was inevitable that the company would seek to monetize more of their product, even suggesting that the Fusion 360 license had been overly generous to begin with. This take undermines the exchange of benefits that takes place between vendors of free software and the communities that spring up around it:</p><p>“Think of the tens of millions of man-hours that have been invested into forum posts helping users, developing plugins, courses, YouTube videos, and Makerspace workshops that could have instead gone into making open source tools like KiCAD, OpenSCAD, pycam, etc better.</p><blockquote><p>"All that work done by hobbyists, for free, helping Autodesk dominate the market in low-end CAD/CAM software.”
— <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/09/16/autodesk-announces-major-changes-to-fusion-360-personal-use-license-terms/#comment-6278789" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sfdsfsdfdsf on Hackaday.com</a></p></blockquote><p>While Autodesk maintained they were still committed to “democratizing design for everyone,” the community didn’t buy it, seeing it as a bid to squeeze money out of hobbyist users after riding their coattails to market domination. As one disappointed user commented:</p><p>“... you showed that you prefer to spend money to block existing features of your software instead of improving it with new paid features. That’s an indicator that you don’t care about the product itself anymore, but that you are just trying to extract the maximum money out of your current users instead.”— <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24498013" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streakycobra on Hacker News</a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-where-did-disgruntled-fusion-users-go">So where did disgruntled Fusion users go?<a href="#so-where-did-disgruntled-fusion-users-go" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So where did disgruntled Fusion users go?" title="Direct link to So where did disgruntled Fusion users go?">​</a></h3><p>Fusion users asked, “What can we use instead?” and the overwhelming sentiment was in favor of supporting free and open source projects that can’t be bought out or taken away.</p><p>As a longtime contributor to FreeCAD I was happy to see it suggested often. The effect can be seen clearly in FreeCAD’s <a href="https://star-history.com/#freecad/freecad&amp;Date" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub star history</a>: the count has more than tripled since September 2020.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="github star history" src="/assets/images/image3-dd64bb7c18bb5cb1272dd53c18ad6688.png" width="1999" height="1410" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Caption: You can see a dramatic 30% star growth after Autodesk’s controversial changes</p><p>The spike in followers for <a href="https://twitter.com/freecadnews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@FreeCADNews</a> tells a story too:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="twitter analytics" src="/assets/images/image1-9df7031de5cc2a123a58503a728c967e.png" width="1786" height="670" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>And here’s the project’s <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growth in contributions</a>:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="contribution growth" src="/assets/images/image2-043049db9603019fa16c72a465619d14.png" width="1830" height="588" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In the 2+ years since Autodesk changed the Fusion 360 license, new communities around FreeCAD have sprung up on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4295230/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCAD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://facebook.com/FreeCAD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>—all with over 3,000 members.</p><p>We know that one of the tradeoffs with FOSS is that sometimes you might need to roll up your sleeves and contribute (time or money) towards the features and fixes you want to see. It’s gratifying to see this growing community getting involved to continue developing FreeCAD into a viable Fusion alternative, without the bait-and-switch risk of proprietary solutions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-to-from-here">Where to from here?<a href="#where-to-from-here" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Where to from here?" title="Direct link to Where to from here?">​</a></h3><p>I’m now working full time on Ondsel, built on top of FreeCAD. While Ondsel’s product set is still being defined, my vision is to improve on the FreeCAD UI to make it more accessible for non-software engineers and build the collaborative features that small businesses and enterprises can benefit from—now with the resources of full-time development talent.</p><p>With open core, the business model is to <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-01-open-core-standard-pricing-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monetize features based on who will use them</a>, with the core product remaining free and open to all. A strong core is integral to Ondsel’s success, as the core features are often an onramp for casual or hobby users who grow into businesses of their own and require different features as they scale.</p><p>Having a solid and active open source ecosystem around it is vital to actually democratizing design for everyone. In the coming months I’ll be hiring engineers to help define this vision and build it with me, but in the meantime I <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Ondsel-Development/discussions/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">would love to hear from you</a> about what you’d like to see from FreeCAD and Ondsel in the future.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The dream of building a commercial company around FreeCAD has been around for a long time…]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On August 17, 2022 the FreeCAD community celebrated its 20th anniversary as an open source project. That was an important milestone … and it passed with hardly anyone noticing. There was another important development last year and it barely got any more attention, even though it was far more consequential.</p><p>I'm referring to the creation of the FPA: FreeCAD Project Association. The FPA is a legal entity whose mission is to advance and protect the FreeCAD project. Besides being able to receive donations and pay for services, the FPA has a formal membership and decision making structure and this matters.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="freecad-is-changing">FreeCAD is changing<a href="#freecad-is-changing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to FreeCAD is changing" title="Direct link to FreeCAD is changing">​</a></h2><p>For many years the FreeCAD project operated as a loose confederacy of core developers.  Decisions were made by consensus. Development moved forward when someone had an itch to scratch and the project philosophy was, "It's done when it's done." That kind of loose government served the project pretty well. Until it didn't.</p><p>As the number of developers grew and the codebase got larger, consensus was harder to reach. Some problems defied consensus altogether. Too often, it felt like nobody was steering the ship. Many people wanted to see a clearer roadmap. They wanted leadership to address those thorny issues. Without a roadmap it was too risky for commercial companies to build around FreeCAD. Without leadership, there was no confidence that big problems would be addressed and industrial users were unwilling to adopt FreeCAD for mission-critical use.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introducing-the-fpa">Introducing the FPA<a href="#introducing-the-fpa" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introducing the FPA" title="Direct link to Introducing the FPA">​</a></h2><p>The FPA was launched with modest goals. The founders wanted to avoid a heavy-handed dictatorial style. They want to encourage the kind of collaboration and consensus that has made the project productive and fun for two decades. They also recognized that FreeCAD is maturing as a project and some formal structure is necessary. I was honored to be part of that process and deeply impressed with the wisdom and care that the founders took to balance these interests.</p><p>While the FPA is still finding its footing, it has already started taking steps that should have everyone excited.</p><p>First, the FPA has money and the willingness to fund development. With it, they can encourage focused effort in areas where organic interest hasn't emerged.</p><p>Even more importantly, the FPA is working to get developers together in the same room. Zoom, email, and issue trackers are the tools we live with and they work well for day-to-day operations. But there's nothing like face-to-face meetings for building trust, resolving conflict, and making long term plans. The ability to work face-to-face is one area where commercial development has a clear advantage over open source software. The FPA recognizes this and is taking steps to change it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="freecad-day-at-fosdem">FreeCAD Day at FOSDEM<a href="#freecad-day-at-fosdem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to FreeCAD Day at FOSDEM" title="Direct link to FreeCAD Day at FOSDEM">​</a></h2><p>The first ever '<a href="https://blog.freecad.org/2023/01/04/freecad-meeting-day-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Day</a>' will be held prior to FOSDEM on February 2, 2023. The day will be organized as an <em>unconference</em>. People attending the event will propose and decide what to do on premises. There will be plenty of opportunities for side discussions.</p><p>FOSDEM brings together developers from hundreds of open source projects. It provides a fantastic opportunity to discuss collaboration opportunities with other projects, learn from their successes and from their mistakes, and meet like-minded folks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ondsel-in-the-room">Ondsel in the room<a href="#ondsel-in-the-room" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ondsel in the room" title="Direct link to Ondsel in the room">​</a></h2><p>The dream of building a commercial company around FreeCAD has been around for a long time. It's one way that developers could build not just a world-class CAD solution but their own careers. Now that Ondsel is finally launched as an open core company we are excited to partner with the FPA and the FreeCAD community at FreeCAD Day 1.0. We look forward to meeting, collaborating, dreaming, and building great things together.</p>]]></content>
