r/PLC</a></p></blockquote><p>When we talk to customers, the question of import/export comes up repeatedly. Working with DWG files is necessary for collaborating with upstream or downstream partner organizations, but these proprietary formats make things extremely difficult if anyone in the chain is not using an official Autodesk tool.</p><blockquote><p>“... Autodesk takes great care to make sure no other CAD tool is 100%
compatible. If you edit a .dwg file with an external editor there is a good
chance you will damage the file and AutoCAD won’t be able to read it again.
This has been a MAJOR headache for decades but unfortunately Autodesk has
vendor-locked entire industries.” — <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cad/comments/wdkm61/comment/iiiz85c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mud_tug on r/CAD</a></p></blockquote><p>There’s no getting around the fact that Autodesk’s tools and formats are effectively industry standards. We’ve already discussed on this blog how <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/hard-lessons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autodesk entrenchment begins with students learning AutoCAD at education institutions</a>, only to discover later that they’ve painted themselves into a corner when it’s too expensive and hard to switch away from. That pipeline leads to entrenchment in industry where the dependence on Autodesk self-perpetuates:</p><blockquote><p>“We use it because we think everyone else is using it, so it is easier to sub
when you are on the same software. Everyone else uses it because they all
think we use it. It’s this endless feedback loop and why Autodesk has such a
tight grip on the construction industry.” — <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Revit/comments/t8qod9/comment/hzpjvv4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">To_Fight_The_Night on r/Revit</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-is-the-de-facto-industry-standard-not-an-open-standard">Why is the de facto ‘industry standard’ not an open standard?<a href="#why-is-the-de-facto-industry-standard-not-an-open-standard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why is the de facto ‘industry standard’ not an open standard?" title="Direct link to Why is the de facto ‘industry standard’ not an open standard?">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dwg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DWG</a> has been in use for 50 years and is widely used to exchange files. While the <code>.dwg</code> file format itself is not a trademark (despite Autodesk’s <a href="https://www.mccarthy.ca/en/insights/articles/court-refuses-extend-trade-mark-protection-file-extensions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attempts to prevent others from using it</a>) it is proprietary. Other programs have reverse engineered solutions to work with the format, but Autodesk actively discourages interoperability between its own DWG files and those created or modified by other programs:</p><blockquote><p>“Autodesk didn’t like the fact that people could use DWG files without paying them, so they made the format progressively more difficult to save and load. Looking at the current format shows they made several attempts at making it difficult, as other programs adapted … In the latest versions of AutoCAD, they&#x27;ve added a key to the format which only they are allowed to use. If another program saves a DWG that loads perfectly well, but does not have that key, AutoCAD will pop up a stern warning about this being an unsupported DWG format that might cause terrible problems. Although it obviously won&#x27;t.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In short, they use their dominance of the marketplace to act like money
grabbing assholes.” — <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cad/comments/smoi5c/comment/hvxxpdp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quaderrordemonstand on r/CAD</a></p></blockquote><p>The challenge with industry standards being closed is that despite Autodesk’s best efforts to maintain a monopoly, not everyone you need to collaborate with has access to the same tooling and same versions. Loss of data and integrity becomes a risk when exchanging files outside of Autodesk’s ecosystem.</p><p>Back in 2020, a number of leading design firms called for better interoperability in an <a href="http://extranetevolution.com/2020/07/design-firms-demand-change-at-autodesk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open letter to Autodesk’s CEO</a>. More than three years later, there doesn’t seem to have been any improvements. Why isn’t there more of an outcry from users?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="autodesk-claims-to-care-about-interoperability">Autodesk claims to care about interoperability<a href="#autodesk-claims-to-care-about-interoperability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Autodesk claims to care about interoperability" title="Direct link to Autodesk claims to care about interoperability">​</a></h2><p>Despite actively impeding interoperability of its proprietary file formats, Autodesk pays lip service to the benefits of interoperability (when it suits them).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="own-your-data-as-long-as-its-within-our-suite">Own your data, as long as it’s within our suite<a href="#own-your-data-as-long-as-its-within-our-suite" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Own your data, as long as it’s within our suite" title="Direct link to Own your data, as long as it’s within our suite">​</a></h3><p>In a paper titled <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/industry/manufacturing/cad-interoperability" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Own Your Data: What Data Portability Means for the Construction Industry”</a>, Autodesk describes the common pain points of disparate teams trying to collaborate with each other and with contractors.</p><blockquote><p>“Each member of a construction team will typically store data in a different location or within a tool available only to their own group. Other team members don’t have access to each other’s data, which makes collecting all the important information in one central location a difficult task. The silo effect is also a roadblock to data and information transparency. A system without transparency is not functional in a modern, tech-enabled construction environment.”</p></blockquote><p>They make a great argument for the value of data portability. The natural conclusion of this argument would be for portability across programs using the same format, but Autodesk uses it to promote its own product, <a href="https://construction.autodesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autodesk Construction Cloud</a>.</p><p>You don’t need everyone to use the same software, but you do need interoperability between software file formats. How does “Own your data” ring true when that data is encoded in a proprietary format?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-standards-when-it-suits-us">Open standards, when it suits us<a href="#open-standards-when-it-suits-us" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open standards, when it suits us" title="Direct link to Open standards, when it suits us">​</a></h3><p>Autodesk is also happy to toot its own horn about interoperability when it comes to their products’ capabilities to <a href="https://damassets.autodesk.net/content/dam/autodesk/www/industry/bim/interoperability-/assets/q2-adsk-atheletes%20vill%20EGA%20customer-story_V0.7_en-us.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read and modify multiple file formats</a>.</p><p>This sentiment does not appear to extend to Autodesk letting its proprietary file formats play nice with other programs. It also feels disingenuous after they attempted to remove support for exporting STEP files from Fusion360 for personal use licensees (then backpedaled after backlash from the community).</p><p>There are many other examples of Autodesk paying lip service to open standards and interoperability, but it’s hard to swallow without any real justification for the company’s continued commitment to keeping DWG closed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-real-reasons-for-closed-formats">The real reasons for closed formats<a href="#the-real-reasons-for-closed-formats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The real reasons for closed formats" title="Direct link to The real reasons for closed formats">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>“… having been through those wars of ‘standard/interoperable file format’ on both the CAD producer and consumer side...

FreeCAD forum</a></p></blockquote><p>We’re not being unrealistic—we don’t expect altruism from vendors that need to turn a profit. However, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/autodesk-enshittifies-fusion-360" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instead of this behavior</a> they could, you know, make a compelling product? Something that performs well and gets new features regularly? Instead the model appears to be focused on buying out and closing down competition and locking users in.</p><blockquote><p>“Autodesk is so bad at actual software improvement. AutoCAD is still a single-core program with some of the same glitches that have been around since the ‘80s.” — <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/10f3i6n/comment/j4v4v35/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DoordashJeans on r/civilengineering</a></p></blockquote><p>The only half-hearted justification we’ve heard from Autodesk for keeping its proprietary file formats closed is that they <a href="https://damassets.autodesk.net/content/dam/autodesk/www/products/new-fusion-360/docs/Tech-Clarity-eBook-CAD-Interoperability.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“can’t afford to compromise capabilities for a standard that works just as well across every CAD tool.”</a></p><p>Some information loss between formats is inevitable. The ability to interpret parametric data and recalculate a model requires the entire geometry kernel and CAD application. This kind of lock-in is unavoidable. When it comes to interoperability though, we don’t expect to transfer the HOW part of the system. We only expect to transfer the WHAT (the geometry of the model). Autodesk however is locking customers in by not allowing them to transfer the geometry at all.</p><p>If users were able to choose their tools purely based on performance and new features instead of trying to avoid the headache of data transfer, Autodesk’s empire would be threatened.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/education">education</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/autodesk">autodesk</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/lock-in">lock-in</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-2bd2c1d2e73f46f62e267eb1d762ecb1.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/hard-lessons">Autodesk is teaching students hard life-lessons about vendor lock-in</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-10-20T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">October 20, 2023</time> · <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://www.thebasementoffice.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="/img/Rebecca-Dodd-profile.JPEG" alt="Rebecca Dodd"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://www.thebasementoffice.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rebecca Dodd</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Contributing Writer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It’s common for vendors to make free licenses available to educational institutions, and while this can be helpful for enabling students to learn the tools of the trade, it can also set them up to learn some hard lessons about vendor lock-in once they go out on their own.</p><p>To add context to this piece we’ve included insights from <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/lukas-du-plessis-21424240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Lukas du Plessis</a>, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Pretoria (specializing in Machine Design and Manufacturing).

They do not do this because they want to nurture the hobbyists or craftspeople.” – <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/09/16/autodesk-announces-major-changes-to-fusion0-personal-use-license-terms/#comment-6279614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrightBlueJim on Hackaday.com</a></p></blockquote><p>It’s not an act of charity or goodwill for vendors to make their software free to use for educational purposes: the entrenchment of tools like SOLIDWORKS and Fusion 360 at these institutions is a key part of their pipeline as students graduate, enter the workforce, and advocate to use familiar tools at work.</p><p>These tools then become entrenched in workplaces, making it difficult for graduates to onboard if they don’t know how to use the software already:</p><blockquote><p>“Not choosing Autodesk is a career ending mistake in many cases, too.” –  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24505752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emteycz on Hacker News</a></p></blockquote><p>This is fine for students joining a big firm with plenty of budget for their seat. But good luck to graduates who want to start their own businesses and suddenly can’t afford the license.</p><p>This pattern is hard to shift, as educators can (understandably) be resistant to the burden of learning and then teaching a new tool. It’s tricky to coordinate across a department and align on what software is being used and taught in different years and modules. Even where educators are willing to bring in free alternatives (like FreeCAD), their lack of polish can be off putting to students.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="your-students-deserve-better">Your students deserve better<a href="#your-students-deserve-better" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Your students deserve better" title="Direct link to Your students deserve better">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>“F360 is probably the easiest to learn, but... I strongly recommend also learning FreeCAD so you have a backup plan if you aren’t made of money.” –  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fusion360/comments/r88l8x/is_fusion360_hard_to_learn/hn6k5b3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LightStormPilot on r/Fusion360</a></p></blockquote><p>As educators, your students are your customers. Your responsibility is to set them up for success by teaching them design principles, not one specific tool. Including exposure to open source solutions in curricula gives students a number of benefits:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="flexibility">Flexibility<a href="#flexibility" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Flexibility" title="Direct link to Flexibility">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>“It’s like a teacher teaching students to write a letter. The emphasis should be on the communication and writing skills—not on the tool. The teacher can’t teach the students to use Microsoft Word in order for them to write the letter.” – Dr Lukas du Plessis, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Pretoria</p></blockquote><p>Of course, it is important to introduce students to industry-standard, commercial software so that  they’re prepared for the workforce, but it’s a disservice not to at least expose them to the alternatives. Students who go into industry will be working in environments with mixed software, and educators should anticipate and include interoperability in the curriculum. They should be skeptical of software provided by corporations that doesn’t support data portability.</p><p>Students should at least understand that the choice of which software they use has long-term implications:</p><ul><li>Will they be able to switch to something else later if it becomes too expensive or no longer serves their needs?</li><li>Will it work on their own computer when they don’t have access to their current setup?</li></ul><p>Open source software unlocks far greater flexibility and customization for different use cases: for example, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxHr9sYNRUo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guitar workbench</a> presented at the <a href="https://www.up.ac.za/mechanical-and-aeronautical-engineering/article/3136162/freecad-users-conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD User Conference</a> earlier this year. “There’s no commercial package that will develop such a workbench, it’s far too niche,” says Dr du Plessis.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="performance">Performance<a href="#performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Performance" title="Direct link to Performance">​</a></h3><p>This aspect of the open source vs proprietary conversation doesn’t always get a lot of airtime, but it’s especially pertinent for educational institutions: commercial CAD software is often extremely hard wearing and resource intensive, and requires bleeding-edge hardware to perform at its best. Educational institutions rarely have access to the kind of hardware needed to make the software run effectively.</p><p>FreeCAD however is better suited for this environment, according to Dr du Plessis: “I introduced FreeCAD at the University of Pretoria and it’s not very hardware intensive—we’ve had no issues in the computer labs.”</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="institutions-can-be-the-change">Institutions can be the change<a href="#institutions-can-be-the-change" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Institutions can be the change" title="Direct link to Institutions can be the change">​</a></h2><p>It’s encouraging to see some educators taking initiative to change the course. Dr du Plessis, as mentioned above, has been advocating for students to get exposure to and learn FreeCAD at the University of Pretoria.</p><p>The university historically has taught SOLIDWORKS to students from their first year. As he started learning FreeCAD himself, Dr du Plessis has been introducing FreeCAD to his second-year students since 2020. “It doesn’t make sense to have access to free software, but then only afterwards the students need to start paying for exorbitant licenses.”</p><p>In 2019, Dr du Plessis received funding from the UK’s <a href="https://africaprize.raeng.org.uk/about-the-prize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royal Academy of Engineering</a> to develop a separate workbench inside FreeCAD. One of the deliverables was to introduce FreeCAD in the university’s undergraduate program, which helped give credibility to the initiative.</p><p>“I make students very much aware of the fact that commercial packages come at a premium,” says Dr du Plessis. “I also push hard for them to understand that there is a free version. Yes, it’s not as refined, but it’s good enough for 95% of what they want to do.”</p><p>Dr du Plessis also has a vision for what he calls FreeCAD Free Labs to make FreeCAD more accessible to more makers.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-educators-and-students-can-do">What educators and students can do<a href="#what-educators-and-students-can-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What educators and students can do" title="Direct link to What educators and students can do">​</a></h2><p>Yes, there is a burden to learning new technology and then teaching it to your students, but there are a lot of free resources out there that you can point students to. You can lean on educational creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FreeCADAcademy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Academy on YouTube</a> and the <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD community</a> so you can focus on teaching design principles.</p><p>To any students reading this, it’s also up to you to take responsibility for your own education. Be wary of any educator that requires a particular tool rather than teaching you the principles of use that can be generalized. You don’t need permission to explore alternative tools.</p><p>The <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Project Association</a> is interested in broadening the use of FreeCAD in education. They’ve set up a brief survey to gather feedback and start building a network of interested people.

Hobbyists, YouTubers, and makers felt betrayed. Now, after more than two years, we can see the effect. Many of those people left Fusion and never looked back.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>“	‘I have altered the deal. Pray I do not alter it further.’
— Darth Vader</p></blockquote><p>If that’s how you’re going to treat the hobbyists, then goodbye forever to Fusion 360.”

These changes felt like a slap in the face, with some members deleting their Fusion 360 accounts in protest (whether or not they were affected by the new limitations).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-proprietary-bait-and-switch">The proprietary bait and switch<a href="#the-proprietary-bait-and-switch" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The proprietary bait and switch" title="Direct link to The proprietary bait and switch">​</a></h3><p>The changes to the license for Fusion 360 for Personal Use were a perfect illustration of the risk of making use of “free as in beer” software. Many users felt betrayed and frustrated at the new limitations:</p><blockquote><p>“The file export limitations in particular are crippling. No .step? .dxf? No extensions??? I can&#x27;t even buy stress simulation credits? … yikes.”
— <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24496171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raynr on Hacker News</a></p></blockquote><p>Some users were not surprised, saying it was inevitable that the company would seek to monetize more of their product, even suggesting that the Fusion 360 license had been overly generous to begin with. This take undermines the exchange of benefits that takes place between vendors of free software and the communities that spring up around it:</p><p>“Think of the tens of millions of man-hours that have been invested into forum posts helping users, developing plugins, courses, YouTube videos, and Makerspace workshops that could have instead gone into making open source tools like KiCAD, OpenSCAD, pycam, etc better.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;All that work done by hobbyists, for free, helping Autodesk dominate the market in low-end CAD/CAM software.”

As one disappointed user commented:</p><p>“... you showed that you prefer to spend money to block existing features of your software instead of improving it with new paid features. That’s an indicator that you don’t care about the product itself anymore, but that you are just trying to extract the maximum money out of your current users instead.”— <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24498013" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streakycobra on Hacker News</a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-where-did-disgruntled-fusion-users-go">So where did disgruntled Fusion users go?<a href="#so-where-did-disgruntled-fusion-users-go" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So where did disgruntled Fusion users go?" title="Direct link to So where did disgruntled Fusion users go?">​</a></h3><p>Fusion users asked, “What can we use instead?” and the overwhelming sentiment was in favor of supporting free and open source projects that can’t be bought out or taken away.</p><p>As a longtime contributor to FreeCAD I was happy to see it suggested often.

While Ondsel’s product set is still being defined, my vision is to improve on the FreeCAD UI to make it more accessible for non-software engineers and build the collaborative features that small businesses and enterprises can benefit from—now with the resources of full-time development talent. With open core, the business model is to <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-01-open-core-standard-pricing-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monetize features based on who will use them</a>, with the core product remaining free and open to all. A strong core is integral to Ondsel’s success, as the core features are often an onramp for casual or hobby users who grow into businesses of their own and require different features as they scale. Having a solid and active open source ecosystem around it is vital to actually democratizing design for everyone. In the coming months I’ll be hiring engineers to help define this vision and build it with me, but in the meantime I <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Ondsel-Development/discussions/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">would love to hear from you</a> about what you’d like to see from FreeCAD and Ondsel in the future.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.
