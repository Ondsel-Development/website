We do have a few things to brag about. We also had some setbacks and challenges. Since we started Ondsel with a goal to be as honest and transparent as possible, let’s talk about things the team learned this year while figuring things out.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="being-part-of-the-freecad-community">Being part of the FreeCAD community<a href="#being-part-of-the-freecad-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Being part of the FreeCAD community" title="Direct link to Being part of the FreeCAD community">​</a></h2><p>The majority of the team — employees and contractors alike — was already involved with the FreeCAD project one way or another prior to the launch of Ondsel.</p><p>I was one of the original authors of the Path workbench that I still maintain and I’m one of the founding members of the FreeCAD Project Association. Ajinkya and Amritpal were former GSoC students who continued contributing after the program was over. Pierre contributed to the Sketcher workbench. Pieter created the <a href="https://osh-autodoc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OSH Automated Documentation</a> workbench. Adrian who recently joined us as contractor had been release manager of FreeCAD for the past couple of years. Alex contributed translation updates and covered FreeCAD news in his blog.</p><p>In other words, we understand how the project works and what challenges it faces.</p><p>Ondsel and FreeCAD have a shared interest: making the software great, creating a thriving ecosystem around it, and encouraging more contribution. At the same time, we’re different and our differences provide both opportunity and challenge.  As a startup, Ondsel has to be commercially successful and it absolutely has to hit certain financial goals in a sensible timeframe. On the other hand, Ondsel can do things that would be difficult or impossible for the FreeCAD project to achieve. Things like SaaS collaboration or CAD “vaulting”. We can bring focused development attention to really hard issues like toponaming and we can more effectively respond to the needs of commercial users.</p><p>Our differences also mean that we <em>must</em> operate differently. As a company we need more predictability. If we contribute a fix or a new feature, and it passes code review but never gets merged, our effort and money is wasted.  If we want that change for our own customers then our code base starts becoming a hard fork, and those are difficult to maintain with a small team. We want to build on top of the great FreeCAD foundation. We don’t want to fork it.  Early on, we asked for a more reliable process where the queue of pull requests gets reviewed on a regular basis and changes are acted on quickly. The community responded, and the merge process is now running remarkably well.</p><p>But guess what; It helps the FreeCAD project just as much as it helps us. Contributors don’t really like when their patches are stuck in limbo for years. It hurts morale and drives contributors away. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-worked-well-and-what--not-so-much">What worked well and what — not so much<a href="#what-worked-well-and-what--not-so-much" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What worked well and what — not so much" title="Direct link to What worked well and what — not so much">​</a></h2><p>Some things worked amazingly well. The merge process was definitely a huge win for everybody. The queue of active PRs is now commonly below 25 items.</p><p>The toponaming project is progressing well despite some tasks taking a lot of time, like the ongoing battle of the TopoShape class with its 94 methods and 5,600 lines of code. The team is now in the middle of the third phase of the project.</p><p>The integrated assembly workbench is shaping up really nicely, we are beginning to see users  demonstrating complexity beyond what we expected and reporting bugs and requests for improvement. The initial implementation will be minimal yet functional, with a solid foundation for further expansion.</p><p>Things didn’t go as smoothly with UX/UI fixes. We’ve had some great results with improving major parts of FreeCAD like Sketcher: new tools, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/floating-input-widgets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floating input widgets, tool settings</a>, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/ondsel-made-constraining-sketches-faster-and-easier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">easy dimensioning</a> etc. Unfortunately, UI discussions on the forum and in GitHub issues continue to be emotional and often counterproductive.</p><p>To be honest, we — the entire FreeCAD development community — have done a poor job of talking to our users. Too often we’re asking them how they want us to build the application. That’s the wrong set of questions.  Instead we should be asking them <em>what they want to accomplish</em>. We should be learning why they need the feature they are asking for so we can implement it in a way that makes sense. It isn’t fair to expect our user base and especially our power users to also be experts in software development. That’s not their role in the community.</p><p>FreeCAD was started by software developers who were also experts in CAD. For a long time, the community had many people like this and made great strides but these are rare people.  Now our community is much larger and has people with a diverse set of skills and experience.  Many of them are using FreeCAD to do amazing things but most aren’t software developers.</p><p>As the project continues to mature, we need to embrace this reality.  We need to build up a team of experts who can work effectively with developers.  We need people with vision, patience, and the ability to communicate the WHY of things.  </p><p>The emerging <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-breaking-open-source-ux-curse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design review team</a> in the FreeCAD community as well as Ondsel haven’t yet gained enough trust from the wider community. Building trust takes time.  It requires us to say what we’re going to do and then follow through. It requires us to demonstrate competence and humility at the same time. I believe that FreeCAD v1.0 release will help a lot with trust simply because of all the much anticipated features and quality-of-life changes it will bring.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="exploring-the-viability-of-freecad-as-a-pro-tool">Exploring the viability of FreeCAD as a pro tool<a href="#exploring-the-viability-of-freecad-as-a-pro-tool" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Exploring the viability of FreeCAD as a pro tool" title="Direct link to Exploring the viability of FreeCAD as a pro tool">​</a></h2><p>Over the course of the entire last year, I conducted several dozen interviews with users from all walks of life: hobbyists, freelance engineers, small business owners, CTOs of larger companies. The frustrating part is that it’s pretty damn hard to find people who do commercial work with FreeCAD. This is an existential problem for the FreeCAD project and also for Ondsel. </p><p>Commercial work is all about turnover, efficiency, and stability. When a software project focuses on building for a commercial audience, the resulting application works for commercial users as well as for hobbyists and other enthusiasts. </p><p>Commercial users push development of advanced features and bring resources that can fund that development. But if the project focuses on meeting every niche desire and special case, if it rushes development features that should be more thoroughly investigated and implemented carefully, if it caters exclusively to the enthusiasts, then the result is hard to learn and maintain.  It won’t be adopted by commercial users at all. </p><p>The project is maturing and it’s time to be more focused on building relationships with users that will demand stability and ease of use as well as advanced features.</p><p>In that sense, getting Stephen Hawes from <a href="https://www.opulo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opulo</a> into the FPA general assembly recently was a smart move. Opulo is a small startup that uses FreeCAD extensively to build their Lumen Pick-and-Place machine.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="takeaways">Takeaways<a href="#takeaways" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Takeaways" title="Direct link to Takeaways">​</a></h2><p>What have we learned?</p><p><strong>Faster release cycles and clear release goals benefit everyone.</strong> We’ve seen an overwhelmingly positive community’s response to the idea that releases should be more frequent and more focused. It also helps the developers make decisions based on priorities. It worked well for us in the past, e.g. when we built a release goal around migrating to Qt5 and when we focused on supporting Python 3, for example. These kinds of release goals work.  Let’s do more of them.</p><p><strong>We need more ‘better’ communication.</strong> Both weekly PR review meetings, bi-weekly TNP meetings, and monthly developer meetings were a tremendous success in terms of helping contributors communicate to each other and sync on their plans. Continuing that is a bare minimum.</p><p><strong>We need more ‘high expense’ communication.</strong> When we did the assembly WB review series and offered a path forward, there was very little unproductive discussion. People mostly got on with that. And now the first feedback we are getting is that workflow-wise the integrated assembly workbench is more or less what people had hoped for. But communicating this way is expensive. There’s a lot of research hours put into this project prior to any coding (which is also not cheap). We need more research like that to help unify vision and clarify goals.</p><p><strong>The project needs more trust between stakeholders.</strong> The FreeCAD project has been going through massive changes for the past few years: new faces, new unusual roles, a non-profit organization backing it, the first company building around FreeCAD commercially etc. This is a lot to take in. We need to find a way to communicate better with each other and build stronger relationships to succeed.</p><p><strong>The ‘commercial’ user base of FreeCAD is too small.</strong> The perception among commercial users is that FreeCAD isn’t ready for real work. We think otherwise. Ondsel doesn’t have to be all things to all users. It is perfectly capable of meeting many needs that commercial users have now.  What’s required is a focus on exposing that capability to a wider audience of commercial users and a focus on minimizing the weaknesses as fast as possible. If we want FreeCAD to excel, we need to talk to people who use CAD programs for work, and we need to do it all the time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next?<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next?" title="Direct link to What’s next?">​</a></h2><p>Our plan is to release a build of FreeCAD that is targeted at commercial users — with more polish all around and an initial version of the integrated assembly workbench, as well as with collaboration and sharing tools.</p><p>We have more interviews already scheduled and we’ll continue listening to users — those who succeeded using FreeCAD for work and those who struggled and chose something else instead. We’ll also invest more time into strengthening our relationship with the FreeCAD community.</p><p>For now, you can <a href="https://ondsel.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grab the latest Ondsel build</a> of FreeCAD, give it a spin and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/7jmzezyyfP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join our Discord server</a> to tell us about your challenges.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ondsel/">ondsel</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad/">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ux/">ux</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ui/">ui</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-b749e31c3475b53baa4ec4746a2dd757.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/freecad-breaking-open-source-ux-curse/">Open Source UI/UX is notoriously bad.

FreeCAD is no exception. Some of the most common complaints raised by users are about the steep learning curve, inconsistent workflow, and ugly, confusing user-interface (UI). There are dozens of threads on the forum going back years where someone has come forward with a vision to ‘fix’ the usability problem. These efforts always devolve into bike-shedding, and nitpicking. Nothing changes.</p><p>Why does this keep happening?  After all, UI/UX is an established discipline. There are books and published research about it.  There are <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consultants</a> and ‘best practices’.  Why is it so hard to make progress?</p><p>The answer is that like other parts of the umbrella discipline called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘human factors’</a>, UI/UX is all about humans and humans are messy.   Unlike source code that either works or doesn’t, there are many ways to skin the usability cat.  Most of us use software all the time with no appreciation or understanding of why it’s good or bad. We know good design when we see it but most of us can’t say why it’s good.  When we use software that we like, we attribute our positive perception to whichever UI elements we notice.  We overlook the thousands of other elements that don’t catch our attention because they just work right.</p><p><em>Mary likes the way DoodlyCAD uses ribbon bars.  FreeCAD doesn’t have ribbon bars and that’s why she hates FreeCAD.  She didn’t notice that DoodlyCAD has consistent task panels, great use of screen real estate, and excellent discoverability of features.</em></p><p>“Ok, smart guy”, I hear you say.  “Is the situation hopeless?  Can we possibly make progress in this area?”.  Yes, dear reader, I think we can.  In fact, I think we are!  A small but industrious team led by Obelisk on the FreeCAD Discord server has started an initiative that aims to avoid the pitfalls of the past and move us in a direction that is data- and research-driven, productive, and sustainable. </p><p>The approach they are taking starts with first principles of UI/UX design.  If you spend time reading the channel, you’ll hear terms like <a href="https://lawsofux.com/fittss-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fitts law</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/weavedesign/the-doherty-threshold-and-designing-for-human-computer-interaction-f0a47c8ab583" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doherty threshold</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hick-Hyman</a>, and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Usability-Heuristics</a>. Rather than focusing on individual features, they are establishing an overarching conception of how the user experience should be organized.  This isn’t a bold new vision with grand unattainable goals.  It first seeks to understand and document how the FreeCAD experience works when it works well. That documentation is the <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/stylebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Guide</a>.</p><p>As the design guide matures, we can use the guidelines to review the user experience when it doesn’t work well and improve it without introducing new inconsistencies.</p><p>The project has larger goals.  They’re spending considerable time talking about zones of the UI, task flow, and what the default configuration should be.  They’re also thinking about how UI templates can be created that make it easier for developers to implement new functionality without needing to reinvent the wheel every time.   Effort has been spent on recommendations for color use, code structure, and other details that will help addon developers make their contributions feel like a native part of FreeCAD.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;After more than 20 years of development by a global community of volunteers, an incredibly complex and advanced set of features is available in FreeCAD. My hope is to leverage all of the incredible time and effort invested by that community to present a coherent vision for both beginner and advanced users that is based on strong principles. With the highly anticipated 1.0 release on the horizon an opportunity to help provide a positive &#x27;out-of-the-box&#x27; experience and improve general productivity is extremely exciting.&quot; -Joe Sardos (Obelisk)</p></blockquote><p>Yet, it’s the short-term objectives that are likely to make the biggest difference soon.  Identifying the easy fixes where user pain can be alleviated fast doesn’t just fix the problems, it gives new developers an easy on-ramp to start contributing code that will get merged.  Documenting the glossary helps with documentation, translation, and the design of future features. Clear guidelines on UI elements makes it easier to develop features and it also speeds up the review and approval process which takes load off of the maintainers.  It also makes documentation easier to write and faster to translate.</p><p>If our enthusiasm for this project isn’t clear, let me give you a few more reasons why we’re so excited this is happening and so honored to participate.   First, the data-driven and research based approach helps eliminate the toxic in-fighting on the forum.  That’s something we can all get behind.  The effort is community-led but not developer driven.  In our opinion, it’s wonderful to see other kinds of experts getting involved in open-source work.  We would love to see FOSS being a place for UI/UX experts to build experience and ultimately a career.  And finally, it provides another opportunity for the FPA to financially advance the project. The FPA is now <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fpadf-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offering grants</a> to train UI/UX contributors who commit to work on this for an extended period. </p><p>Unlike other development efforts like the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-needs-a-better-materials-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Material system overhaul</a> or the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly Workbench</a>,  improving the UI is a long-term commitment.  It’s many, <em>many</em> small improvements over time and not a single major push from a few people.  It will take time but it will work.  We’re on our way to a great user experience.  Forward!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad/">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ux/">ux</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ui/">ui</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer bg-transparent footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col flex footer-layout"><div><div class="footer__title">Contact Us</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="mailto:contact@ondsel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">contact@ondsel.com<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ondsel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">facebook<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://x.com/ondsel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item" title="Follow us on X"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="18px"><g><path fill="white" d="M18.244 2.25h3.308l-7.227 8.26 8.502 11.24H16.17l-5.214-6.817L4.99 21.75H1.68l7.73-8.835L1.254 2.25H8.08l4.713 6.231zm-1.161 17.52h1.833L7.084 4.126H5.117z"></path></g></svg><svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_node_modules-@docusaurus-theme-classic-lib-theme-Icon-ExternalLink-styles-module" style="vertical-align: text-top;"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="col footer__col flex footer-layout"><div><div class="footer__title">Legal</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/tos/">Terms of Service</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="col footer__col flex footer-layout"><div><div class="footer__title">FreeCAD</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://freecad.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Website<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="footer__bottom copy_right text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 Ondsel, Inc.</div></div></div></footer></div>
