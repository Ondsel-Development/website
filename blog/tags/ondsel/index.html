We came back with several important takeaways:</p><ul><li><strong>Licencing policies of proprietary CAD vendors annoy users to no end.</strong> Even some of the more affordable mainstream 3D CAD solutions, while rather powerful, drive users nuts: more and more limitations to what you can do, vendor lock-in, formerly free features disappearing behind paywalls etc.</li><li><strong>FOSS tools are usually rejected by professional users unless they are mature..</strong> Many users flee from those mainstream CAD platforms to open-source, but they have to deal with various technical limitations, missing features, and general lack of UX/UI polish.</li><li><strong>Collaboration is really important.</strong> A lot of users need a convenient platform to upload and share/visualize a project (vaulting) or even work together on a project (PDM).</li></ul><p>So our thinking was: we should focus on a polished user experience and features that are essential to professional use. Let’s build something we feel good about recommending it to someone working on a deadline. And let’s build a service for vaulting and collaboration.</p><p>Enter Ondsel ES. Building on FreeCAD, Ondsel ES is integrated with Ondsel Lens, an online vault for 3D CAD files with elements of a PDM system.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Ondsel ES" src="/assets/images/ondsel-es-intro-ddfeb16de0b97f3000655dbf9692efe3.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Our primary objective is to provide polish and sorely missing features — that’s a large part of the added value. We’ve made big and small changes in the upstream project, but the four vital projects for us have been toponaming, integrated assembly workbench, UX/UI, and collaboration.</p><p>The work on the toponaming problem is an ongoing project, and we are very grateful to the FreeCAD community for contributing a lot to that effort. But it’s not complete yet, there will be much more to say when it’s largely done. So let’s focus on the other three.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="integrated-assembly-workbench">Integrated Assembly workbench<a href="#integrated-assembly-workbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Integrated Assembly workbench" title="Direct link to Integrated Assembly workbench">​</a></h2><p>Ondsel ES is shipping with an early preview of the integrated Assembly workbench that is being built for the upstream project.</p><p>The workbench provides a simple workflow: create new or link existing parts, ground one part, select a joint type, select two geometric features, confirm. That is all it takes to attach one part to another.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Editing joint local system" src="/assets/images/assembly-jcs-editing-c5123022b000f3caee76e03902b1985b.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The Assembly workbench features direct dragging for moving parts around before and after joining them. Within the assembly, there’s no need to use a transform tool. You just grab a part and drag it where it belongs.</p><p>Even though we have been testing the assembly workbench mostly on simple projects, users of the pre-release have been making impressive things and stress-testing it which helps us a lot. The community is simply the best.</p><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Live assembly by Kwahoo" src="/assets/images/kwahoo-6d40a346fe9209982b40920bc00e3ce3.webp" width="1083" height="930" class="img_ev3q">
<a href="https://t.co/UeGP5PVjcr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kwahoo&#x27;s tweet</a></p><p>Most of the work on the integrated Assembly workbench has been done by Dr. Aik-Siong Koh and Pierre-Louis Boyer, with some contributions from developers in the FreeCAD community. The assembly example project we ship with Ondsel ES originally comes from Jose Gabriel Egas Ortuño.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="uxui-and-sketcher">UX/UI and Sketcher<a href="#uxui-and-sketcher" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to UX/UI and Sketcher" title="Direct link to UX/UI and Sketcher">​</a></h2><p>Before joining Ondsel, Pierre-Louis spent some time developing various improvements for the Sketcher workbench, <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=65521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely supported by the community</a>. With Ondsel backing his work, he completed these patches and got most of them merged into the upstream project.. You can try them for yourself today in Ondsel ES.</p><p><strong>Smart dimensioning.</strong> Once you select two geometric features, the Dimension tool will figure out what the most applicable constraint for that combination is and apply it. This new tool effectively replaces half a dozen separate constraint tools: horizontal and vertical distance, distance, radius, diameter, angle. You can pretty much dimension an entire sketch with just one tool.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/smart-dimensions.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p><strong>Floating input widgets help quickly constraining sketches.</strong> When you have a pretty good idea of what you are drafting and what all the dimensions are, this new way of drawing a sketch is a huge productivity booster. Select a tool, hover the mouse pointer over canvas and input numbers, press <strong>Tab</strong> to go from one parameter to the next one.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Floating input widgets in Sketcher" src="/assets/images/floating-input-widgets-79604402dfe07b9dd01067790a220b34.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Tool settings reduce toolbar bloat and introduce new features.</strong> Now you can easily enable/disable the rounding of rectangles, set how many sides you want in a polygon, or which method you use to construct an arc — all instead of extra buttons.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Tool parameters in Sketcher" src="/assets/images/tool-parameters-6a6c77a0e9f5af7a347c9f518f29e8aa.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Automatic horizontal/vertical constraint tool.</strong> This new tool helps fixing sketches where straight lines are not quite horizontal or vertical. You can use it to point and click on the lines of interest, or you can pre-select entire shapes and then click on the tool to automatically apply contextually relevant constraints.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/auto-hor-vert-constraint.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p><strong>More sketching tools: Translates, Rotate, Scale, Offset.</strong> It’s what users have been asking for since the early days of Sketcher. The tools are finally available and do just what it says on the label and then some. For instance, the <em>Rotate</em> tool has a <em>Copies</em> option that allows creating polar patterns.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Rotate / Polar Patterns" src="/assets/images/rotate-polar-patterns-0cba199089a7d1ee010dd41ea32756ea.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Copying and pasting in Sketcher.</strong> Now you can select geometry in Sketcher and cut or copy and paste it using conventional shortcuts or the main menu.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="collaboration-with-ondsel-lens">Collaboration with Ondsel Lens<a href="#collaboration-with-ondsel-lens" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Collaboration with Ondsel Lens" title="Direct link to Collaboration with Ondsel Lens">​</a></h2><p>Ondsel ES integrates with Lens — our digital vault for your 3D CAD files, with elements of a product data management (PDM) system. You can upload and explore 3D CAD designs, create multiple workspaces for yourself or for your collaborators.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" style="max-width:100%" src="https://lens.ondsel.com/share/65af04b361821ca0c25d2afc" title="Ondsel"></iframe><p>Lens will be available in three tiers to meet the most common user needs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="solo">Solo<a href="#solo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Solo" title="Direct link to Solo">​</a></h3><p>This is the free tier of Lens. It’s a great way to experiment with what a PDM system does without spending a lot of money. In the solo tier, all designs that you upload are public. If you’re working on a project that you want to share or where privacy isn’t a concern, the solo tier may be all you need. Simply upload an FCStd or an OBJ file, create a public link, and share it wherever you like. Your shared model will also appear in <a href="https://lens.ondsel.com/public-models" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the public gallery</a>. </p><p>We implemented link unfurling in Lens, so social networks that also support unfurling should be able to render a preview of your model in a post. And if you are a member of the FreeCAD forum, Lens is a convenient place to store models that you want to embed in your posts. Or you could embed your models on a website or an online shop.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Share Model options" src="/assets/images/share-model-bee97405cf4e7a3763a2bfc1f1d4eaa5.webp" width="2560" height="1285" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="peer">Peer<a href="#peer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Peer" title="Direct link to Peer">​</a></h3><p>If privacy is important or if you need  to control what the viewer is allowed to download, the Peer tier is for you. Specifically designed for professionals who work independently, it provides privacy and control over your models, offers more storage space, and allows for parametric models that can be updated on the server. You can keep project files in the default workspace or organize different projects as multiple workspaces.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Personal workspaces" src="/assets/images/personal-workspaces-3b49fa847e2afe29f9d1fa36ce3525f6.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>When you have something to show your customer or a manufacturer you work with, you can create open links for your private designs and set what types of files are downloadable. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Options for sharing models" src="/assets/images/share-model-options-c197e40824a5eefb8ec920e31bf453bf.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Just because you work independently doesn’t mean you work alone.  We’ve heard from professionals who are collaborating with others on projects that are being built in the ‘open hardware’ model. The Peer tier also allows you to create ‘open’ organizations, invite collaborators, and control write access.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enterprise">Enterprise<a href="#enterprise" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enterprise" title="Direct link to Enterprise">​</a></h3><p>For larger teams working on proprietary designs, we will be introducing the Enterprise tier.  Enterprise gives full control over model visibility, read/write access, and group management. Many more features are planned for the enterprise tier that will make Ondsel a powerful addition to your toolkit.</p><p>Ondsel Lens also has some extras that you do not typically get in affordable 3D CAD vaults.</p><p>For engineers who design inherently customizable things (think <a href="https://gridfinity.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gridfinity</a>), Lens provides a user interface for <strong>custom properties</strong> made with the PropertyBag feature of the Path workbench. This means a user can open someone else’s model in Lens, change some attributes to their liking, then download and 3D-print an STL file. This opens quite a few possibilities for makers and hackerspaces.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Model Attributes" src="/assets/images/model-attributes-2a5c583191e4c8d1d08601e102c3fc74.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>PropertyBag is not the greatest solution out there. We are working on a replacement that won’t require switching to Path and will play well with FreeCAD’s <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Expressions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expression engine</a> (see our earlier <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/build-system-for-custom-data-elements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> with preliminary research).</p><p>And because we are building PDM functionality, Ondsel Lens supports <strong>versioning</strong>. You can create multiple timestamped revisions of design files, add revision comments (messages), make a particular version an active one (i.e. displayed by default), and download specific versions.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Versions control" src="/assets/images/versions-3abc11895fde79a7ca6726647338091b.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Most work on Ondsel Lens has been done by Amritpal Singh and John Dupuy.</p><p>The integration layer between Ondsel ES and Ondsel Lens is an <a href="https://github.com/Ondsel-Development/Ondsel-Lens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source addon</a>. We ship it as part of Ondsel ES, but it’s also available for upstream FreeCAD via the Addon Manager.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Addon for Ondsel Lens" src="/assets/images/lens-addon-f42d97c6f42b3e51a5d1ef3c32d4f7b9.webp" width="2562" height="1640" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You can log into Lens, browse available workspaces, open files that you previously uploaded into your vault, switch between available versions, modify them, and then commit these revisions as new versions. You can also use the addon to generate open links and set download permissions without opening Ondsel Lens in your browser.</p><p>The addon was created by Pierre-Louis Boyer and Pieter Hijma.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="respecting-your-digital-rights">Respecting your digital rights<a href="#respecting-your-digital-rights" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Respecting your digital rights" title="Direct link to Respecting your digital rights">​</a></h2><p>The source code of Ondsel ES is <a href="https://github.com/Ondsel-Development/FreeCAD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public</a> and available under the same license as upstream FreeCAD, which is LGPLv2+. The same applies to the Lens addon.</p><p>We contribute our changes to the upstream project. The Ondsel team is relatively small, we wouldn’t be able to maintain a hard fork. It’s in our best interests to play fairly with the community.</p><p>Files created by Ondsel ES are FreeCAD files. Anything you create with Ondsel can be opened in FreeCAD and vice versa.  This compatibility is important to us and we know it’s important to our users. One caveat: Ondsel ES includes the new Assembly workbench because we think it’s important to get feedback early and to let users build the most common kinds of assemblies that they need.  But this workbench functionality is still being reviewed by the upstream project.   Assemblies you create in Ondsel can be opened in FreeCAD but will not have the full assembly functionality until the entirety of the workbench has been accepted..</p><p>As for the files that you upload to Lens, your original 3D CAD designs will always remain your property.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next" title="Direct link to What’s next">​</a></h2><p>We expect to spend the next few months polishing features that we have already implemented in both Ondsel ES and Lens, and exploring our next steps based on your feedback, as well as the results of the recent user survey. Some of our immediate plans for Lens include displaying assemblies, ability to control visibility of parts, support for colored bodies.</p><p>There’s an active <a href="https://discord.com/invite/7jmzezyyfP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chat on Discord</a> where many early adopters provide feedback.

Since we started Ondsel with a goal to be as honest and transparent as possible, let’s talk about things the team learned this year while figuring things out.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="being-part-of-the-freecad-community">Being part of the FreeCAD community<a href="#being-part-of-the-freecad-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Being part of the FreeCAD community" title="Direct link to Being part of the FreeCAD community">​</a></h2><p>The majority of the team — employees and contractors alike — was already involved with the FreeCAD project one way or another prior to the launch of Ondsel.</p><p>I was one of the original authors of the Path workbench that I still maintain and I’m one of the founding members of the FreeCAD Project Association. Ajinkya and Amritpal were former GSoC students who continued contributing after the program was over. Pierre contributed to the Sketcher workbench. Pieter created the <a href="https://osh-autodoc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OSH Automated Documentation</a> workbench. Adrian who recently joined us as contractor had been release manager of FreeCAD for the past couple of years. Alex contributed translation updates and covered FreeCAD news in his blog.</p><p>In other words, we understand how the project works and what challenges it faces.</p><p>Ondsel and FreeCAD have a shared interest: making the software great, creating a thriving ecosystem around it, and encouraging more contribution. At the same time, we’re different and our differences provide both opportunity and challenge.  As a startup, Ondsel has to be commercially successful and it absolutely has to hit certain financial goals in a sensible timeframe. On the other hand, Ondsel can do things that would be difficult or impossible for the FreeCAD project to achieve. Things like SaaS collaboration or CAD “vaulting”. We can bring focused development attention to really hard issues like toponaming and we can more effectively respond to the needs of commercial users.</p><p>Our differences also mean that we <em>must</em> operate differently. As a company we need more predictability. If we contribute a fix or a new feature, and it passes code review but never gets merged, our effort and money is wasted.  If we want that change for our own customers then our code base starts becoming a hard fork, and those are difficult to maintain with a small team. We want to build on top of the great FreeCAD foundation. We don’t want to fork it.  Early on, we asked for a more reliable process where the queue of pull requests gets reviewed on a regular basis and changes are acted on quickly. The community responded, and the merge process is now running remarkably well.</p><p>But guess what; It helps the FreeCAD project just as much as it helps us. Contributors don’t really like when their patches are stuck in limbo for years. It hurts morale and drives contributors away. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-worked-well-and-what--not-so-much">What worked well and what — not so much<a href="#what-worked-well-and-what--not-so-much" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What worked well and what — not so much" title="Direct link to What worked well and what — not so much">​</a></h2><p>Some things worked amazingly well. The merge process was definitely a huge win for everybody. The queue of active PRs is now commonly below 25 items.</p><p>The toponaming project is progressing well despite some tasks taking a lot of time, like the ongoing battle of the TopoShape class with its 94 methods and 5,600 lines of code. The team is now in the middle of the third phase of the project.</p><p>The integrated assembly workbench is shaping up really nicely, we are beginning to see users  demonstrating complexity beyond what we expected and reporting bugs and requests for improvement. The initial implementation will be minimal yet functional, with a solid foundation for further expansion.</p><p>Things didn’t go as smoothly with UX/UI fixes. We’ve had some great results with improving major parts of FreeCAD like Sketcher: new tools, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/floating-input-widgets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floating input widgets, tool settings</a>, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/ondsel-made-constraining-sketches-faster-and-easier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">easy dimensioning</a> etc. Unfortunately, UI discussions on the forum and in GitHub issues continue to be emotional and often counterproductive.</p><p>To be honest, we — the entire FreeCAD development community — have done a poor job of talking to our users. Too often we’re asking them how they want us to build the application. That’s the wrong set of questions.  Instead we should be asking them <em>what they want to accomplish</em>. We should be learning why they need the feature they are asking for so we can implement it in a way that makes sense. It isn’t fair to expect our user base and especially our power users to also be experts in software development. That’s not their role in the community.</p><p>FreeCAD was started by software developers who were also experts in CAD. For a long time, the community had many people like this and made great strides but these are rare people.  Now our community is much larger and has people with a diverse set of skills and experience.  Many of them are using FreeCAD to do amazing things but most aren’t software developers.</p><p>As the project continues to mature, we need to embrace this reality.  We need to build up a team of experts who can work effectively with developers.  We need people with vision, patience, and the ability to communicate the WHY of things.  </p><p>The emerging <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-breaking-open-source-ux-curse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design review team</a> in the FreeCAD community as well as Ondsel haven’t yet gained enough trust from the wider community. Building trust takes time.  It requires us to say what we’re going to do and then follow through. It requires us to demonstrate competence and humility at the same time. I believe that FreeCAD v1.0 release will help a lot with trust simply because of all the much anticipated features and quality-of-life changes it will bring.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="exploring-the-viability-of-freecad-as-a-pro-tool">Exploring the viability of FreeCAD as a pro tool<a href="#exploring-the-viability-of-freecad-as-a-pro-tool" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Exploring the viability of FreeCAD as a pro tool" title="Direct link to Exploring the viability of FreeCAD as a pro tool">​</a></h2><p>Over the course of the entire last year, I conducted several dozen interviews with users from all walks of life: hobbyists, freelance engineers, small business owners, CTOs of larger companies. The frustrating part is that it’s pretty damn hard to find people who do commercial work with FreeCAD. This is an existential problem for the FreeCAD project and also for Ondsel. </p><p>Commercial work is all about turnover, efficiency, and stability. When a software project focuses on building for a commercial audience, the resulting application works for commercial users as well as for hobbyists and other enthusiasts. </p><p>Commercial users push development of advanced features and bring resources that can fund that development. But if the project focuses on meeting every niche desire and special case, if it rushes development features that should be more thoroughly investigated and implemented carefully, if it caters exclusively to the enthusiasts, then the result is hard to learn and maintain.  It won’t be adopted by commercial users at all. </p><p>The project is maturing and it’s time to be more focused on building relationships with users that will demand stability and ease of use as well as advanced features.</p><p>In that sense, getting Stephen Hawes from <a href="https://www.opulo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opulo</a> into the FPA general assembly recently was a smart move. Opulo is a small startup that uses FreeCAD extensively to build their Lumen Pick-and-Place machine.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="takeaways">Takeaways<a href="#takeaways" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Takeaways" title="Direct link to Takeaways">​</a></h2><p>What have we learned?</p><p><strong>Faster release cycles and clear release goals benefit everyone.</strong> We’ve seen an overwhelmingly positive community’s response to the idea that releases should be more frequent and more focused. It also helps the developers make decisions based on priorities. It worked well for us in the past, e.g. when we built a release goal around migrating to Qt5 and when we focused on supporting Python 3, for example. These kinds of release goals work.  Let’s do more of them.</p><p><strong>We need more ‘better’ communication.</strong> Both weekly PR review meetings, bi-weekly TNP meetings, and monthly developer meetings were a tremendous success in terms of helping contributors communicate to each other and sync on their plans. Continuing that is a bare minimum.</p><p><strong>We need more ‘high expense’ communication.</strong> When we did the assembly WB review series and offered a path forward, there was very little unproductive discussion. People mostly got on with that. And now the first feedback we are getting is that workflow-wise the integrated assembly workbench is more or less what people had hoped for. But communicating this way is expensive. There’s a lot of research hours put into this project prior to any coding (which is also not cheap). We need more research like that to help unify vision and clarify goals.</p><p><strong>The project needs more trust between stakeholders.</strong> The FreeCAD project has been going through massive changes for the past few years: new faces, new unusual roles, a non-profit organization backing it, the first company building around FreeCAD commercially etc. This is a lot to take in. We need to find a way to communicate better with each other and build stronger relationships to succeed.</p><p><strong>The ‘commercial’ user base of FreeCAD is too small.</strong> The perception among commercial users is that FreeCAD isn’t ready for real work. We think otherwise. Ondsel doesn’t have to be all things to all users. It is perfectly capable of meeting many needs that commercial users have now.  What’s required is a focus on exposing that capability to a wider audience of commercial users and a focus on minimizing the weaknesses as fast as possible. If we want FreeCAD to excel, we need to talk to people who use CAD programs for work, and we need to do it all the time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next?<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next?" title="Direct link to What’s next?">​</a></h2><p>Our plan is to release a build of FreeCAD that is targeted at commercial users — with more polish all around and an initial version of the integrated assembly workbench, as well as with collaboration and sharing tools.</p><p>We have more interviews already scheduled and we’ll continue listening to users — those who succeeded using FreeCAD for work and those who struggled and chose something else instead. We’ll also invest more time into strengthening our relationship with the FreeCAD community.</p><p>For now, you can <a href="https://ondsel.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grab the latest Ondsel build</a> of FreeCAD, give it a spin and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/7jmzezyyfP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join our Discord server</a> to tell us about your challenges.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ondsel/">ondsel</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad/">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ux/">ux</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ui/">ui</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-1d4df470ffd929076b7ae604f6c49878.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/dont-lose-your-open-source-soul/">Don’t lose your (open-source) soul: Why we founded Ondsel as a Public Benefit Company</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 1, 2023</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><blockquote><p>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
-Mark 8:36</p></blockquote><p>Late last year I was talking with <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Core Ventures</a> about the possibility of starting Ondsel.  It was exciting to hear from people outside the FreeCAD community who shared the vision that this software was important and could be so much more than it already is.   As the idea of actually starting a company took hold,  the first important decision was which legal structure the new company would have.  Two things that I read deeply affected me and shaped the final decision.</p><p>The first was <a href="https://www.cooleygo.com/delaware-public-benefit-corporation-is-it-right-for-you-a-five-part-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article by Jen Barnette that highlighted five considerations for being a public benefits corporation</a> (PBC).</p><p>At a time when ambition often clashes with integrity, the formation of Ondsel as a Public Benefit Company (PBC) should stand as a testament to our belief in conscious entrepreneurship. The ethos of open-source software, characterized by collaboration and transparency, frequently finds itself at odds with the profit-driven dynamics of the modern tech landscape. Ondsel&#x27;s genesis as a PBC exemplifies a commitment to upholding the soul of open-source values, even in the pursuit of success.
Open-source software, a cornerstone of the digital age, embodies the spirit of sharing, transparency, and collective betterment. But, as projects mature, they can wrestle with the challenges of sustainability. Developers who once dedicated themselves to a project out of love find their efforts ensnared by financial considerations and proprietary boundaries, straying from the core essence of openness. Ondsel&#x27;s inception as a PBC is a direct response—a proactive stance to prevent the dilution of these core values.
The five points that Jen described meshed well with my own thinking and I made sure to include them in <a href="https://ondsel.com/handbook/About/public_benefit_corp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our own handbook</a>.  I revisit them often to make sure my thinking doesn’t drift away from the core values we started with.</p><p>The second thing I read was Simon Sinek’s book <a href="https://simonsinek.com/books/the-infinite-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Infinite Game</em></a>.  He suggests that a company should have a “just cause”  that inspires people because it explains <em>why</em> you’re doing what you do.</p><p>For me, this one was easy.
Human beings are creative and social creatures. Not everyone creates physical things but Everyone is a maker of ideas. We enjoy sharing our ideas, talking about them and improving them. Sometimes those ideas turn into physical things that have beauty, utility, and value.  These days, you need tools to express your ideas so others can build on them and we need everyone’s best ideas.
People deserve access to tools to help them express their ideas, share them with other people, and use them to produce useful things that benefit all of us.  Ondsel wants to make powerful, efficient, and beautiful design tools available to more people.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ondsel/">Ondsel</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-b3ec42aea1e279302a096a83bfed28bb.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/ondsel-100-days/">Ondsel at 100...Days</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-04-14T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">April 14, 2023</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="100-days">100 Days<a href="#100-days" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 100 Days" title="Direct link to 100 Days">​</a></h2><p>It’s hard to believe that it’s been just over three months since Ondsel started operations.  One hundred days, in fact.  I thought it would be fun to take a moment and consider what we’ve been able to accomplish in that time.</p><p>First, we built a team.  Besides myself, Ondsel now has five people working on the future of FreeCAD.  We were able to recruit, interview, hire, equip, and onboard five exceptionally talented people who hit the ground running and started contributing to FreeCAD.</p><p>We attended FOSDEM in Brussels in February where we got to meet with <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project leaders</a>.  We heard from many users who both love FreeCAD but are frustrated with the lack of progress on some big problems.  We learned a ton and we were able to build consensus on a path forward.</p><p>From that, we laid out a plan for finally resolving the topo-naming problem.  One of our people, <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnDupuyCOMO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@JohnDupuyCOMO</a> refined <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/8432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the plan</a> to incorporate <a href="https://twitter.com/RealThunder12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RealThunder</a>’s algorithm, and the developer community not only accepted it but started working with blazing speed to accomplish it.  The first phase was completed in only a couple of weeks.  Now we’ve started phase two.</p><p>We started building the Ondsel brand.  We got a logo designed, put up a <a href="https://ondsel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, and established accounts on <a href="https://twitter.com/ondsel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ondsel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ondsel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, and other platforms.  We’ve taken our Twitter following from zero to almost two hundred followers.</p><p>We built relationships with some outstanding creators including <a href="https://twitter.com/Basement_Office" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebecca Dodd</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lgworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexandre Prokoudine</a> who are helping to create our blog content and communicate our vision.  </p><p>We worked with <a href="https://reedydesigns.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reedy Designs</a> and to reskin the website in just over a week.</p><p>We initiated the <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FPA Handbook</a> and contributed content to it.</p><p>We initiated the new<a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Developer’s Handbook</a> and are continuing to add new content to it as well.</p><p>We started our own <a href="https://ondsel.com/docs/handbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">handbook</a> which will be an indispensable part of our company culture.</p><p>We published more than a dozen blog posts including a seven-part series on Assembly.</p><p>Our Assembly series started a <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=76799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community-wide discussion</a> about an integrated assembly workbench — a much-needed core capability of FreeCAD.
