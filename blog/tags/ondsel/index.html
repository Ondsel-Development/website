We do have a few things to brag about. We also had some setbacks and challenges. Since we started Ondsel with a goal to be as honest and transparent as possible, let’s talk about things the team learned this year while figuring things out.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="being-part-of-the-freecad-community">Being part of the FreeCAD community<a href="#being-part-of-the-freecad-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Being part of the FreeCAD community" title="Direct link to Being part of the FreeCAD community">​</a></h2><p>The majority of the team — employees and contractors alike — was already involved with the FreeCAD project one way or another prior to the launch of Ondsel.</p><p>I was one of the original authors of the Path workbench that I still maintain and I’m one of the founding members of the FreeCAD Project Association. Ajinkya and Amritpal were former GSoC students who continued contributing after the program was over. Pierre contributed to the Sketcher workbench. Pieter created the <a href="https://osh-autodoc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OSH Automated Documentation</a> workbench. Adrian who recently joined us as contractor had been release manager of FreeCAD for the past couple of years. Alex contributed translation updates and covered FreeCAD news in his blog.</p><p>In other words, we understand how the project works and what challenges it faces.</p><p>Ondsel and FreeCAD have a shared interest: making the software great, creating a thriving ecosystem around it, and encouraging more contribution. At the same time, we’re different and our differences provide both opportunity and challenge.  As a startup, Ondsel has to be commercially successful and it absolutely has to hit certain financial goals in a sensible timeframe. On the other hand, Ondsel can do things that would be difficult or impossible for the FreeCAD project to achieve. Things like SaaS collaboration or CAD “vaulting”. We can bring focused development attention to really hard issues like toponaming and we can more effectively respond to the needs of commercial users.</p><p>Our differences also mean that we <em>must</em> operate differently. As a company we need more predictability. If we contribute a fix or a new feature, and it passes code review but never gets merged, our effort and money is wasted.  If we want that change for our own customers then our code base starts becoming a hard fork, and those are difficult to maintain with a small team. We want to build on top of the great FreeCAD foundation. We don’t want to fork it.  Early on, we asked for a more reliable process where the queue of pull requests gets reviewed on a regular basis and changes are acted on quickly. The community responded, and the merge process is now running remarkably well.</p><p>But guess what; It helps the FreeCAD project just as much as it helps us. Contributors don’t really like when their patches are stuck in limbo for years. It hurts morale and drives contributors away. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-worked-well-and-what--not-so-much">What worked well and what — not so much<a href="#what-worked-well-and-what--not-so-much" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What worked well and what — not so much" title="Direct link to What worked well and what — not so much">​</a></h2><p>Some things worked amazingly well. The merge process was definitely a huge win for everybody. The queue of active PRs is now commonly below 25 items.</p><p>The toponaming project is progressing well despite some tasks taking a lot of time, like the ongoing battle of the TopoShape class with its 94 methods and 5,600 lines of code. The team is now in the middle of the third phase of the project.</p><p>The integrated assembly workbench is shaping up really nicely, we are beginning to see users  demonstrating complexity beyond what we expected and reporting bugs and requests for improvement. The initial implementation will be minimal yet functional, with a solid foundation for further expansion.</p><p>Things didn’t go as smoothly with UX/UI fixes. We’ve had some great results with improving major parts of FreeCAD like Sketcher: new tools, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/floating-input-widgets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floating input widgets, tool settings</a>, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/ondsel-made-constraining-sketches-faster-and-easier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">easy dimensioning</a> etc. Unfortunately, UI discussions on the forum and in GitHub issues continue to be emotional and often counterproductive.</p><p>To be honest, we — the entire FreeCAD development community — have done a poor job of talking to our users. Too often we’re asking them how they want us to build the application. That’s the wrong set of questions.  Instead we should be asking them <em>what they want to accomplish</em>. We should be learning why they need the feature they are asking for so we can implement it in a way that makes sense. It isn’t fair to expect our user base and especially our power users to also be experts in software development. That’s not their role in the community.</p><p>FreeCAD was started by software developers who were also experts in CAD. For a long time, the community had many people like this and made great strides but these are rare people.  Now our community is much larger and has people with a diverse set of skills and experience.  Many of them are using FreeCAD to do amazing things but most aren’t software developers.</p><p>As the project continues to mature, we need to embrace this reality.  We need to build up a team of experts who can work effectively with developers.  We need people with vision, patience, and the ability to communicate the WHY of things.  </p><p>The emerging <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-breaking-open-source-ux-curse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design review team</a> in the FreeCAD community as well as Ondsel haven’t yet gained enough trust from the wider community. Building trust takes time.  It requires us to say what we’re going to do and then follow through. It requires us to demonstrate competence and humility at the same time. I believe that FreeCAD v1.0 release will help a lot with trust simply because of all the much anticipated features and quality-of-life changes it will bring.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="exploring-the-viability-of-freecad-as-a-pro-tool">Exploring the viability of FreeCAD as a pro tool<a href="#exploring-the-viability-of-freecad-as-a-pro-tool" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Exploring the viability of FreeCAD as a pro tool" title="Direct link to Exploring the viability of FreeCAD as a pro tool">​</a></h2><p>Over the course of the entire last year, I conducted several dozen interviews with users from all walks of life: hobbyists, freelance engineers, small business owners, CTOs of larger companies. The frustrating part is that it’s pretty damn hard to find people who do commercial work with FreeCAD. This is an existential problem for the FreeCAD project and also for Ondsel. </p><p>Commercial work is all about turnover, efficiency, and stability. When a software project focuses on building for a commercial audience, the resulting application works for commercial users as well as for hobbyists and other enthusiasts. </p><p>Commercial users push development of advanced features and bring resources that can fund that development. But if the project focuses on meeting every niche desire and special case, if it rushes development features that should be more thoroughly investigated and implemented carefully, if it caters exclusively to the enthusiasts, then the result is hard to learn and maintain.  It won’t be adopted by commercial users at all. </p><p>The project is maturing and it’s time to be more focused on building relationships with users that will demand stability and ease of use as well as advanced features.</p><p>In that sense, getting Stephen Hawes from <a href="https://www.opulo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opulo</a> into the FPA general assembly recently was a smart move. Opulo is a small startup that uses FreeCAD extensively to build their Lumen Pick-and-Place machine.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="takeaways">Takeaways<a href="#takeaways" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Takeaways" title="Direct link to Takeaways">​</a></h2><p>What have we learned?</p><p><strong>Faster release cycles and clear release goals benefit everyone.</strong> We’ve seen an overwhelmingly positive community’s response to the idea that releases should be more frequent and more focused. It also helps the developers make decisions based on priorities. It worked well for us in the past, e.g. when we built a release goal around migrating to Qt5 and when we focused on supporting Python 3, for example. These kinds of release goals work.  Let’s do more of them.</p><p><strong>We need more ‘better’ communication.</strong> Both weekly PR review meetings, bi-weekly TNP meetings, and monthly developer meetings were a tremendous success in terms of helping contributors communicate to each other and sync on their plans. Continuing that is a bare minimum.</p><p><strong>We need more ‘high expense’ communication.</strong> When we did the assembly WB review series and offered a path forward, there was very little unproductive discussion. People mostly got on with that. And now the first feedback we are getting is that workflow-wise the integrated assembly workbench is more or less what people had hoped for. But communicating this way is expensive. There’s a lot of research hours put into this project prior to any coding (which is also not cheap). We need more research like that to help unify vision and clarify goals.</p><p><strong>The project needs more trust between stakeholders.</strong> The FreeCAD project has been going through massive changes for the past few years: new faces, new unusual roles, a non-profit organization backing it, the first company building around FreeCAD commercially etc. This is a lot to take in. We need to find a way to communicate better with each other and build stronger relationships to succeed.</p><p><strong>The ‘commercial’ user base of FreeCAD is too small.</strong> The perception among commercial users is that FreeCAD isn’t ready for real work. We think otherwise. Ondsel doesn’t have to be all things to all users. It is perfectly capable of meeting many needs that commercial users have now.  What’s required is a focus on exposing that capability to a wider audience of commercial users and a focus on minimizing the weaknesses as fast as possible. If we want FreeCAD to excel, we need to talk to people who use CAD programs for work, and we need to do it all the time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next?<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next?" title="Direct link to What’s next?">​</a></h2><p>Our plan is to release a build of FreeCAD that is targeted at commercial users — with more polish all around and an initial version of the integrated assembly workbench, as well as with collaboration and sharing tools.</p><p>We have more interviews already scheduled and we’ll continue listening to users — those who succeeded using FreeCAD for work and those who struggled and chose something else instead. We’ll also invest more time into strengthening our relationship with the FreeCAD community.</p><p>For now, you can <a href="https://ondsel.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grab the latest Ondsel build</a> of FreeCAD, give it a spin and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/7jmzezyyfP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join our Discord server</a> to tell us about your challenges.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ondsel/">ondsel</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad/">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ux/">ux</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ui/">ui</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-1d4df470ffd929076b7ae604f6c49878.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/dont-lose-your-open-source-soul/">Don’t lose your (open-source) soul: Why we founded Ondsel as a Public Benefit Company</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 1, 2023</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><blockquote><p>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
-Mark 8:36</p></blockquote><p>Late last year I was talking with <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Core Ventures</a> about the possibility of starting Ondsel.  It was exciting to hear from people outside the FreeCAD community who shared the vision that this software was important and could be so much more than it already is.   As the idea of actually starting a company took hold,  the first important decision was which legal structure the new company would have.  Two things that I read deeply affected me and shaped the final decision.</p><p>The first was <a href="https://www.cooleygo.com/delaware-public-benefit-corporation-is-it-right-for-you-a-five-part-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article by Jen Barnette that highlighted five considerations for being a public benefits corporation</a> (PBC).</p><p>At a time when ambition often clashes with integrity, the formation of Ondsel as a Public Benefit Company (PBC) should stand as a testament to our belief in conscious entrepreneurship. The ethos of open-source software, characterized by collaboration and transparency, frequently finds itself at odds with the profit-driven dynamics of the modern tech landscape. Ondsel&#x27;s genesis as a PBC exemplifies a commitment to upholding the soul of open-source values, even in the pursuit of success.
Open-source software, a cornerstone of the digital age, embodies the spirit of sharing, transparency, and collective betterment. But, as projects mature, they can wrestle with the challenges of sustainability. Developers who once dedicated themselves to a project out of love find their efforts ensnared by financial considerations and proprietary boundaries, straying from the core essence of openness. Ondsel&#x27;s inception as a PBC is a direct response—a proactive stance to prevent the dilution of these core values.
The five points that Jen described meshed well with my own thinking and I made sure to include them in <a href="https://ondsel.com/handbook/About/public_benefit_corp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our own handbook</a>.  I revisit them often to make sure my thinking doesn’t drift away from the core values we started with.</p><p>The second thing I read was Simon Sinek’s book <a href="https://simonsinek.com/books/the-infinite-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Infinite Game</em></a>.  He suggests that a company should have a “just cause”  that inspires people because it explains <em>why</em> you’re doing what you do.</p><p>For me, this one was easy.
Human beings are creative and social creatures. Not everyone creates physical things but Everyone is a maker of ideas. We enjoy sharing our ideas, talking about them and improving them. Sometimes those ideas turn into physical things that have beauty, utility, and value.  These days, you need tools to express your ideas so others can build on them and we need everyone’s best ideas.
People deserve access to tools to help them express their ideas, share them with other people, and use them to produce useful things that benefit all of us.  Ondsel wants to make powerful, efficient, and beautiful design tools available to more people.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ondsel/">Ondsel</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-b3ec42aea1e279302a096a83bfed28bb.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/ondsel-100-days/">Ondsel at 100...Days</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-04-14T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">April 14, 2023</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="100-days">100 Days<a href="#100-days" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 100 Days" title="Direct link to 100 Days">​</a></h2><p>It’s hard to believe that it’s been just over three months since Ondsel started operations.  One hundred days, in fact.  I thought it would be fun to take a moment and consider what we’ve been able to accomplish in that time.</p><p>First, we built a team.  Besides myself, Ondsel now has five people working on the future of FreeCAD.  We were able to recruit, interview, hire, equip, and onboard five exceptionally talented people who hit the ground running and started contributing to FreeCAD.</p><p>We attended FOSDEM in Brussels in February where we got to meet with <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project leaders</a>.  We heard from many users who both love FreeCAD but are frustrated with the lack of progress on some big problems.  We learned a ton and we were able to build consensus on a path forward.</p><p>From that, we laid out a plan for finally resolving the topo-naming problem.  One of our people, <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnDupuyCOMO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@JohnDupuyCOMO</a> refined <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/8432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the plan</a> to incorporate <a href="https://twitter.com/RealThunder12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RealThunder</a>’s algorithm, and the developer community not only accepted it but started working with blazing speed to accomplish it.  The first phase was completed in only a couple of weeks.  Now we’ve started phase two.</p><p>We started building the Ondsel brand.  We got a logo designed, put up a <a href="https://ondsel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, and established accounts on <a href="https://twitter.com/ondsel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ondsel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ondsel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, and other platforms.  We’ve taken our Twitter following from zero to almost two hundred followers.</p><p>We built relationships with some outstanding creators including <a href="https://twitter.com/Basement_Office" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebecca Dodd</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lgworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexandre Prokoudine</a> who are helping to create our blog content and communicate our vision.  </p><p>We worked with <a href="https://reedydesigns.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reedy Designs</a> and to reskin the website in just over a week.</p><p>We initiated the <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FPA Handbook</a> and contributed content to it.</p><p>We initiated the new<a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Developer’s Handbook</a> and are continuing to add new content to it as well.</p><p>We started our own <a href="https://ondsel.com/docs/handbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">handbook</a> which will be an indispensable part of our company culture.</p><p>We published more than a dozen blog posts including a seven-part series on Assembly.</p><p>Our Assembly series started a <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=76799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community-wide discussion</a> about an integrated assembly workbench — a much-needed core capability of FreeCAD.  The discussion has had more than fifteen thousand views and hundreds of comments.  We got some great insights that helped us shape the vision for this feature.</p><p>Another of our developers <a href="https://twitter.com/ajinkyapdahale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ajinkyadahale</a> <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8530" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">completed</a> our contract to <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=75950" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improve spline construction</a> in sketdcher for the <a href="https://floss.social/@opentoolchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Tool Chain Foundation</a>.</p><p>Yet another of our developers <a href="https://twitter.com/amrit3701" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@amrit3701</a> has been building the infrastructure to support our eventual product — a subject you will hear much more about in the coming months.</p><p>We got eight pull requests merged into the FreeCAD master branch, including PRs for topo-naming and many quality-of-life improvements by <a href="https://twitter.com/pierrelouisboy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@pierrelouisboy</a>: <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9173</a>, <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9172" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9172</a>, <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9143</a>, <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9117</a>, <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9080</a>, <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9026</a>, <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9010</a>, <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8990</a>.</p><p>We did all that in one-hundred days and I’m sure I’m missing many more things we did along the way.</p><p>I’m incredibly grateful, humbled, proud and excited.
