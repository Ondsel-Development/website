itemprop="articleBody"><p>Last month, we ran a user survey to better understand who FreeCAD users are: how they use FreeCAD, what they do at work, what major gripes with the software they have, and more. Over the course of one week, 650 people answered our questions and provided extended insights. They learned about the survey and came to it from more than ten different websites and social media platforms.</p><p>We combined that data with information we got from other sources, such as YouTube analytics, GitHub downloads data, and membership on various social platforms.</p><p>Our takeaways from studying the results and matching datasets against each other fall under three general categories: demographics, addons ecosystem, major issues users have with FreeCAD. This is the first post in the series, let’s focus on demographics here.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="essential-demographic-data">Essential demographic data<a href="#essential-demographic-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Essential demographic data" title="Direct link to Essential demographic data">​</a></h2><p>Is it possible to estimate the entire user base of FreeCAD at all? It’s not going to be easy. We know the data on all social platforms (as of early February):</p><table><thead><tr><th>Platform</th><th>Count</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>FreeCAD Forum</td><td>51433</td></tr><tr><td>/r/FreeCAD subreddit</td><td>18800</td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn FreeCAD group</td><td>4140</td></tr><tr><td>FreeCAD Facebook Group</td><td>20100</td></tr><tr><td>FreeCAD Powerusers</td><td>4700</td></tr><tr><td>X @freecadnews followers)</td><td>15900</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>115073</td></tr></tbody></table><p>But obviously, there are limitations: there is an overlap between those platforms, some users never follow FreeCAD on those social platforms, and there are inactive forum users and Twitter followers. The forum consistently has more anonymous visitors than registered users active at any time.</p><p>We can also look at downloads:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="downloads vs release" src="/assets/images/downloads-vs-release-296d00327459fa44946606d7629a8b32.webp" width="1175" height="726" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>But we don’t know how many of those downloads are automatic and how many are repeated downloads by the same people. We also don’t know how many users downloaded, tried using it a few times, and then moved on. Nor do we know how many users get their downloads from their Linux distributions.</p><p>The only way to have a better understanding of the user base size is to build a ‘phone home’ feature to tell us if a user sitting on a particular IP address loaded the program at least once in a week (or month). However this likely won’t sit well with many users over privacy concerns. And as this has to be an opt-in feature, it’s possible that most users will not enable it, which will render the collected data useless. So why bother?</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>While we don’t have reliable data about the size of the user base, our educated guess based on downloads and community membership is somewhere between 850K and 1.25 million. </p></div></div><p>We didn’t ask basic questions like age or gender, because we already have this information from YouTube analytics for our channel:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Age and gender per YouTube stats" src="/assets/images/age-gender-d67594a3f08b16a3f41e480490649e43.webp" width="884" height="784" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We discussed this with a few youtubers who run popular channels for FreeCAD users, and the situation is more or less the same: very few student-aged users and older people, almost no women, virtually no 13-17 aged kids.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="who-are-the-users">Who are the users?<a href="#who-are-the-users" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Who are the users?" title="Direct link to Who are the users?">​</a></h2><p>Let’s take a quick look at the following general datasets: “Industries“, “Hobbyists vs pro users”, “Jobs”, and “Making money with FreeCAD”.</p><p>Industries:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Industries" src="/assets/images/industries-283675fd559d3580a78a8ebfa094f0b6.webp" width="1497" height="673" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We combined some of the responses into larger categories:</p><ul><li>Architecture, Construction, Engineering — essentially, everything that has to do with buildings and civil engineering.</li><li>Product Engineering — designing physical products, primarily using mechanical design tools.</li><li>Computing — people working in software development companies as solution architects, developers, consultants etc.</li></ul><p>One thing that we could have done better here is separating “hobby” industries from “pro” industries, because a number of people use FreeCAD both at work and for hobby, and those aren’t necessarily the same industries. Much of the “Other” category is actually all kinds of use for hobbies like woodworking (with CNC), designing small appliances for fun, 3D printing etc.</p><p>Hobbyists vs professionals:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Hobby vs Pro use" src="/assets/images/hobby-vs-pro-e7666b89e1f78de97dc99759558f44fa.webp" width="1087" height="673" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This is somewhat surprising: we had very modest expectations for people using FreeCAD professionally. Actual numbers surpassed our expectations. In hindsight this makes sense. The ‘non-hobby’ group includes users who are using the software professionally as well as those who use it at work but not as their primary role or in a revenue-generating way. For example, researchers and students wouldn’t be in the hobby category but also wouldn’t consider themselves ‘professional’ CAD users. This became clearer when we asked them about making money with FreeCAD.</p><p>Making money with FreeCAD:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Money" src="/assets/images/money-1f32f083b89679e8d94bebe3f31faed2.webp" width="1087" height="673" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We are pleasantly surprised to see that more than one in five users has used FreeCAD to make money.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="experience-with-cad">Experience with CAD<a href="#experience-with-cad" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Experience with CAD" title="Direct link to Experience with CAD">​</a></h2><p>People who have used either lots of other CAD programs or none whatsoever are both minorities. Most users have experience with 1 to 5 other programs:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Other CAD programs" src="/assets/images/other-cad-programs-c677aeaf79b539edffe1d62818e17e6f.webp" width="1368" height="575" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>There is a somewhat expected correlation between experience with other programs and satisfaction with FreeCAD:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Satisfaction vs experience vs other CAD programs" src="/assets/images/satisfaction-vs-experience-c092797aa36ca02ecc6d3b83a284f0c4.webp" width="946" height="730" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>There are two noteworthy things here. First, the feature satisfaction trend line is not as steep as the one for UI/UX satisfaction. This suggests that for experienced users, features are less of a problem as compared to UI/UX.</p><p>Secondly, note that the trend line for “UI/UX satisfaction vs Experience with other CAD” flattens out at 3-5 and actually goes back up a little. It looks like FreeCAD doesn’t stack against competition very well. But some of the users who truly have seen it all are more likely to cut FreeCAD developers some slack.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="takeaways">Takeaways<a href="#takeaways" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Takeaways" title="Direct link to Takeaways">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-user-base-is-highly-diverse-in-industries">The user base is highly diverse in industries<a href="#the-user-base-is-highly-diverse-in-industries" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The user base is highly diverse in industries" title="Direct link to The user base is highly diverse in industries">​</a></h3><p>There’s just no way around it: FreeCAD users are all over the map. This is not a problem per se, but it means that we need to pay a lot of attention to how well FreeCAD works for very different groups of users. For instance, there might be a need for fine-tuning the user experience for architects or mechanical engineers one way or another.</p><p>The survey gave us a glimpse into the variety of uses that FreeCAD gets from its community. We need more and better data on that to make good decisions, feature- and UX-wise.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="people-are-using-freecad-for-real-work">People are using FreeCAD for Real Work™<a href="#people-are-using-freecad-for-real-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to People are using FreeCAD for Real Work™" title="Direct link to People are using FreeCAD for Real Work™">​</a></h2><p>As we have already mentioned, we expected fewer people to be using FreeCAD professionally. It’s a good kind of being wrong, but it also means that we need to prioritize development for professional use. We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: if FreeCAD gets the job done for a professional working on a deadline, it will likely get the job done in the prosumer market as well. In that sense, FreeCAD might not be ready for every professional need, but there are many tasks for which it is a great choice.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="demographic-disparities">Demographic disparities<a href="#demographic-disparities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Demographic disparities" title="Direct link to Demographic disparities">​</a></h2><p>The audience data form YouTube analytics was sampled two weeks after publishing the Ondsel ES 2024.1 video, when there were ca. 20K views of it. Shortly before that video, the 18-24 age range accounted for mere 2% of visitors. Now, a month after that screenshot was taken, this age group is hovering between 8% and 9%.</p><p>The lack of 13-17 kids is not surprising: we upload our videos as not targeted at kids, and so do many other youtubers. No surprises there. But this only accounts for users who would see our videos suggested by the platform. That means that there are also virtually no 13-17 users in the core FreeCAD audience. This is hardly an age-specific thing: so far, there have been over a million 3D printing related videos published on TikTok, accounting for over 18bln views (<a href="https://tiktokhashtags.com/hashtag/3dprinting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>). Is FreeCAD too messy for the younger generation?</p><p>We don’t have survey data supporting the staggering disparity between males and females that we see in YouTube statistics. What we do know is that it’s common for other FreeCAD channels on YouTube, as well as for FOSS-related websites. We also know that women made 16.7% of the engineering workforce in the U.S. in 2023 <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as per U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> — much more than what <em>we</em> see. This kind of disparity <a href="https://www.toptal.com/open-source/is-open-source-open-to-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been studied</a> in other FOSS communities and generally attributed to unwelcoming culture. We don’t know if that’s the case here but it’s worth considering.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-conclusion">In conclusion<a href="#in-conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to In conclusion" title="Direct link to In conclusion">​</a></h2><p>We spent many years trusting our guts instead of studying the community. While some of our assumptions turned out to be right, some of the results challenged our understanding of who FreeCAD users are and what they want.</p><p>Let’s hear your thoughts about the takeaways. Stay tuned for the next post in the series that covers the importance of addons for FreeCAD users!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad/">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/community/">community</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/survey/">survey</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-5ed57909a33cbfb7fd907e08ee431480.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/contribution-barriers/">When your Definition of Done is a barrier to contributors (and other reasons working with first-timers is hard)</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-02-09T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">February 9, 2023</time> · <!-- -->8 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://www.thebasementoffice.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="/img/Rebecca-Dodd-profile.JPEG" alt="Rebecca Dodd"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://www.thebasementoffice.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rebecca Dodd</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Contributing Writer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>First-timers can have a hard time getting started with open source. It doesn’t have to be that way.</em></p><p>Open-source projects are dependent on an engaged community of contributors, but fostering that community comes with its challenges. Depending on what stage an open source project is at, what the community needs from contributors changes. The good news is that intentional coaching and engagement from project maintainers can work at any stage.</p><p>The common gripes with getting started as a new open source contributor usually center around how welcoming the project is and how easy it is to get your contribution merged. There are a few ways that projects can make it hard (both intentionally and not). Here are some examples:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-prickly-maintainers">1.

To credit Araq, this PR did eventually get merged, but it’s a great illustration of how a project’s culture determines its accessibility to new contributors. This PR proposed a change that would make it easier for users to engage with the project, and it was shut down (at first) pretty abruptly. </p><p>Actions like this prompted a handful of contributors to hard fork the project, creating <a href="https://github.com/nim-works/nimskull" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nimskull</a>. One of the new project’s contributors shared their motivations:</p><p>“At the moment we are focused on making it easier to work with the codebase - more documentation, cutting down on decades-old cruft and legacy features, unraveling mysteries of the commit messages that were written with <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/19211#issuecomment-9859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this attitude...</a> (‘I have no intention to follow this guideline so I cannot accept it.’)” —<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32023998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haxscramper</a></p><p>Hard forking is one way to create the project environment you want for contributors, but it is extreme. The default perception of such a move is hostile, tending to assume that the creators don’t want to work on change from within and have an ax to grind with the original project’s maintainer. You can see this sentiment play out in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32021299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacker News discussion about Nimskull</a>. As one commenter pointed out though:</p><p>“If they had tried to alter the original project to suit themselves, you would have said ‘they can just fork if they don&#x27;t like it’” —<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32033998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian_K_White</a></p><p>Whether Nimskull delivers on its promises is yet to be seen, but the example Illustrates how the maintainers and community of a project can impact contributions:</p><p>How easy do they make it to contribute?
How clear are the requirements?
How quickly are pull requests reviewed and merged?
How collaborative and patient are the reviewers?</p><p>All of these factors influence how likely someone is to become a contributor. A hard fork that does this better can be an incentive for the original project to do better, but there are other approaches you can take which I’ll explore in a moment.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-an-intimidating-contribution-process">2. An intimidating contribution process<a href="#2-an-intimidating-contribution-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. An intimidating contribution process" title="Direct link to 2. An intimidating contribution process">​</a></h3><p>Being realistic, it’s unlikely that a beginner will be submitting code to the Linux kernel. But it’s a good example of how the way a project accepts contributions can encourage or discourage new folks. Submitting a patch can be extremely intimidating—the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> admits this in the very first line! It can feel like you’re presenting your work to a panel of faceless judges instead of sharing it with a group of your peers.</p><p>The kernel development community and other projects that operate this way (such as Postgres) have their reasons, which may even include not wanting to encourage rookie contributions! I’m not suggesting they change it, but for newcomers, submissions that feel more conducive to collaboration (such as a pull request) are likely to be less threatening.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-an-onerous-definition-of-done">3. An onerous Definition of Done<a href="#3-an-onerous-definition-of-done" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. An onerous Definition of Done" title="Direct link to 3. An onerous Definition of Done">​</a></h3><p>“It doesn&#x27;t take egregious individual behavior to create a hostile environment.” — Dan Luu, <a href="http://danluu.com/discourage-oss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to discourage open source contributions</a></p><p>While early projects have few or no contributors, they may welcome almost any contribution in pursuit of building the community around the project. Even a bad contribution can lead to an interesting discussion and maybe a better idea.</p><p>As the project matures and the network grows, the overhead of handling contributions becomes a problem. Facing a backlog of hundreds of pull requests, projects may optimize for “good” contributions by implementing more stringent requirements. I know from firsthand experience as a longtime <a href="https://www.freecad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD</a> contributor. As the project grew and matured, it became harder for amateurs to contribute. The Definition of Done became more demanding (for example we needed the right test cases and code formatting) and these more stringent requirements can be off putting or prohibitive, even without intimidating maintainers.</p><p>“The GitLab Definition of Done is now 30 items or something … so it’s harder and harder for people who are just starting to contribute.” — <a href="https://youtu.be/Q9SEYJb-eio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sid Sijbrandij</a>, CEO and co-founder of GitLab</p><p>This barrier to entry illustrates the tension between what the project needs to ensure the quality of its codebase, and what’s inclusive to new contributors. There is a balance to be struck between being welcoming to newcomers in your community, maintaining standards for contributions to your project, and the effort required to make the twain meet. It’s not always going to be possible or advisable to reduce the requirements for getting code merged.</p><p>You might imagine that having the resources of a for-profit company would help, but it’s no guarantee that they will invest in it. In <a href="http://danluu.com/discourage-oss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to discourage open source contributions</a> Dan Luu shared an anonymized example of a project in which contributors get increasingly frustrated and discouraged when their PRs aren’t reviewed or merged, or when they have to jump through hoops to meet requirements. Although Dan didn’t put the project on blast, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1pczpr/how_to_discourage_open_source_contributions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit users figured out what it was</a>: a library maintained by GitHub. We don’t know why GitHub employees weren’t engaging, but it demonstrates how simply having full-time staff isn’t enough to ensure an active project.</p><p>We can see from the examples I shared that these challenges plague projects wherever they are on the spectrum, whether they’re small and maintained by a handful of hobbyist contributors, large and prestigious, or stewarded by a big enterprise organization. If you want an active community where new and drive-by contributors are as welcome as your diehards (and most projects can benefit from a blend of both), you need to be intentional about fostering it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-make-it-easier-to-contribute-to-your-project-and-why-its-worth-the-effort">How to make it easier to contribute to your project (and why it’s worth the effort)<a href="#how-to-make-it-easier-to-contribute-to-your-project-and-why-its-worth-the-effort" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to make it easier to contribute to your project (and why it’s worth the effort)" title="Direct link to How to make it easier to contribute to your project (and why it’s worth the effort)">​</a></h3><p>GitLab’s solution is a role called <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/expert/merge-request-coach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merge Request Coaches</a>. There is literally a line in the job description that says, “Make it easy to contribute to GitLab even for people who are new to Ruby, JavaScript, Golang, etc. or programming entirely.” Merge Request Coaches triage community submissions and enable new contributors by walking them through the process to meet the acceptance criteria.</p><p>The open core model makes it possible for companies to invest in the core project with the benefit of full-time engineers on payroll; formalizing a coach role goes a step further by making it someone’s job to foster new contributors to the core. It’s my hope to pursue this solution with <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-01-ondsel-freecad-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ondsel</a>, to make it easier for people to contribute to FreeCAD, on top of which Ondsel is built.</p><p>Paying people to assist newcomers requires will and investment, which is not always possible in OSS projects run entirely by volunteers. There are examples though of volunteer coaches or mentors in open source: Kubernetes has its <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contributor Experience Special Interest Group</a>, which states, “Developing and sustaining a healthy community of contributors is critical to scaling the project and growing the ecosystem.” <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md#mentoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mentoring new contributors</a> is part of the program. The <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenStack</a> project also has a <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/common/mentoring.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mentoring program</a>, with a cohort dedicated to helping people get their first patch merged.</p><p>By directing some volunteers’ efforts towards coaching, they become force multipliers for the project, with an impact far beyond their own contributions. When you invest in mentoring efforts, you’re not only improving the quality of the contributions, you’re nurturing future contributors who are no longer adding to your overhead; now they’re helping to share the load.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.
