In this part, we take a closer look at Assembly 2, one of the early approaches to adding this feature set to FreeCAD.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="history">History<a href="#history" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to History" title="Direct link to History">​</a></h3><p>A FreeCAD user publicly known as Hamish started this project in late 2014. This is the <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=4&amp;t=8577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original announcement</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I have written an assembly workbench for FreeCAD v0.15, which I am posting here for everyone&#x27;s perusal. <!-- -->[...]<!-- --> I realize that there is mostly likely heavy development on FreeCAD&#x27;s inbuilt assembly wb, which i could have just used for my assembly needs.
However since FreeCAD provides such an excellent environment for building custom wbs, I decided to rather write my own wb exactly tailored to my needs <!-- -->[...]<!-- -->
Hope someone else finds the assembly2 wb useful</p></blockquote><p>2015 was the most active year for the project. However, in 2016, the original developer <a href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=16591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stopped writing new code</a> and the next maintainer, Roland Frank, <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=25673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">passed away in 2017</a>. Hamish and another contributor, kbwbe, continued merging occasional pull requests: bug fixes, a Newton solver, and a port to Python 3 to make the workbench generally supported by newer versions of FreeCAD.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="commit graph" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-2-commit-history-cfa322b6f81b0b460534cef769ef0df3.png" width="1761" height="548" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Assembly2 Commit History</em></p><p>However, in 2018, kbwbe started working on a <a href="https://github.com/kbwbe/A2plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rewrite of Assembly 2</a> and eventually dropped out of contributing to this workbench. There have been no changes in the git repository since 2019.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workflow-and-ease-of-use">Workflow and ease of use<a href="#workflow-and-ease-of-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use" title="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://github.com/hamish2014/FreeCAD_assembly2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 2</a> only supports the bottom-up approach where you design and save parts as files and then import them for an assembly into a new FreeCAD project. It will read both FreeCAD, OBJ, IGES, and STEP files. The workbench expects that the user either enables the visibility of just one body in the design file or creates files with single-body parts. Sub-assemblies are possible, however.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graber I3 model by Nemesis81" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-2-01-500fa911f5bf96ffd089c232695b49b8.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q">
<em><a href="https://github.com/Nemesis81/GraberI3_Freecad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graber I3 model by Nemesis81</a></em></p><p>After importing, spatial constraints need to be added and solved. Imported parts can be manually updated when the linked original file changes. Overall, it’s a straightforward workflow: import multiple parts from respective files, select parts’ features, add constraints, solve, done.</p><p>Problems begin to arise when a change is required. Assembly 2 does not have a dynamic solver. So once you change something like a distance or an angle, you have to create a constraint anew. Moreover, only some features in the workbench support undo/redo.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features">Features<a href="#features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Features" title="Direct link to Features">​</a></h3><p>Constraints available in Assembly 2 are limited to circular edge, plane, axial, angular (for planes), and spherical surface. There are a few tools to work with constraints like flipping their directions.</p><p>Once constraints are done and solved, you can animate degrees of freedom to check for clearances and collisions in any combination of their respective positions. Additionally, it’s possible to check the entire assembly for overlapping parts.</p><p>Assembly 2 also allows creating a list of parts, for which it uses the <a href="https://github.com/hamish2014/FreeCAD_drawing_dimensioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drawing Dimensioning</a> workbench by the same original developer. Which, in return, only works with page objects created with the Drawing workbench. It’s also possible to create one object from all or just the selected parts in an assembly to display them in a drawing. Notably, the <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Drawing_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drawing</a> workbench is now deprecated and replaced by the <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/TechDraw_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechDraw</a> workbench.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consistency">Consistency<a href="#consistency" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Consistency" title="Direct link to Consistency">​</a></h3><p>The way the user interface is organized is in line with the rest of FreeCAD. However, for people new to assemblies, watching a few tutorials on YouTube will be really helpful. Unfortunately, the documentation on the workbench in the FreeCAD’s wiki is scarce: it only lists available features and doesn’t provide any information on them that you wouldn’t be able to see in the tooltips of the actual user interface.</p><p>Assembly 2 can work with parts created in other workbenches like <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/SheetMetal_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SheetMetal</a> or parts created with ‘importer’ workbenches like <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/KicadStepUp_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KiCadStepUp</a> or <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Fasteners_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fasteners</a>. However, because it demands just one body to be visible in an imported project and does not allow choosing which body to import, placing an entire board into an enclosure will require a lot of time and patience.</p><p>The workbench also doesn’t follow the more recent trend of making 3rd party workbenches translatable.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graber I3 model by Nemesis81" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-2-02-d34cd09ae326623400b361eed672fa01.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q">
<em><a href="https://github.com/Nemesis81/GraberI3_Freecad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graber I3 model by Nemesis81</a></em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stability">Stability<a href="#stability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stability" title="Direct link to Stability">​</a></h3><p>Because this assembly workbench is not maintained, the issue tracker has been deactivated on GitHub. So there’s no aggregated information on bugs and their severity. When used with a recent version of FreeCAD, the workbench has various glitches. The general recommendation appears to be keeping a copy of an older FreeCAD version (typically, v0.16 or v0.17) around to open old files that use this assembly workbench. For new users, the recommendation is to try one of the newer assembly workbenches.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="performance">Performance<a href="#performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Performance" title="Direct link to Performance">​</a></h3><p>Despite its simplicity, Assembly 2 can be very slow on medium-to-complex projects. One of the recommendations to deal with that is by creating <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=146813#p146813" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sub-assemblies</a>: effectively saving an assembly as a FreeCAD project, then importing it to another assembly. This removes some complexity from the project but reportedly <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=4&amp;t=26803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does not solve</a> all performance issues.</p><p>Moreover, the interference checker takes the simple road of trying all possible pairs, and this can go on for a very long time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development-status">Development Status<a href="#development-status" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development Status" title="Direct link to Development Status">​</a></h3><p>There have never been official versioned releases of Assembly 2. Active development on this workbench ceased in 2016-2017. This workbench has been unmaintained since 2019. One of its features (list of parts) depends on another unmaintained 3rd party workbench by the same original developer, and another feature (consolidation of objects) depends on a deprecated official workbench (Drawing).`</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h3><p>Assembly 2 is a fairly straightforward yet very barebone solution for creating assemblies. It imposes a particular way of organizing a project, has a limited set of constraints, requires either a lot of planning or a lot of manual work because of lacking a dynamic solver, relies on obsolete workbenches for some of its features, and has been unmaintained since 2019. As such, it has served its purpose well and is now generally considered superseded by A2plus, Assembly 3, and Assembly 4.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-up">Next up<a href="#next-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next up" title="Direct link to Next up">​</a></h3><p>In the next installment, we’ll take a close look at the major iteration of this workbench called A2plus.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.

It‘s commonly required when designing something more complex than a simple replacement part. However in FreeCAD, this feature is only available as a separately installed workbench. In fact, there are 3 competing workbenches and 1 more workbench that has been unmaintained for almost 4 years now. And then there are several more workbenches like <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Manipulator_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manipulator</a> or <a href="https://github.com/DeepSOIC/Part-o-magic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part-o-magic</a>, that can be used to align parts in some way.</p><p>This effectively means that instead of launching FreeCAD, creating an assembly, and loading parts into it for aligning, users are expected to first explore at least half a dozen options by trial and error. The expectation that this much choice is good for them seems unrealistic.</p><p>Moreover, having this many competing solutions leads to development fragmentation, makes following tutorials confusing, and makes progress on the core slower as developers have to consider the impact on multiple approaches to assembly. Moreover, there is a strong demand for technical design tools where collaboration is easy. But collaboration implies using the same tools and standards. Having multiple competing assembly options is the opposite of that.</p><p>Our intention is to start a broad conversation. We want to highlight the need and build consensus that a single default workbench is in the best interest of our users. We&#x27;re also proposing criteria for evaluating the current assembly workbenches. Our goal should be to identify the best foundation and feature set required for an assembly workbench to be included in the core FreeCAD distribution. Such a solution doesn&#x27;t need to meet everyone&#x27;s needs. Rather, it should strive to be a general-purpose solution for at least 80% of the use-cases.</p><p>We do understand the implications of carrying out and publishing this research and calling for a default. Whatever default assembly workbench FreeCAD gets, it automatically moves into focus and gets more tutorials, more testing, more bug reports, more improvements etc. And the non-default workbenches will automatically get less attention and their developers will likely have to cater to more niche areas. So this requires careful treatment. Part of that is being objective when evaluating the existing options.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="methodology">Methodology<a href="#methodology" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Methodology" title="Direct link to Methodology">​</a></h3><p>To make a fair assessment, we need to settle on a set of evaluation criteria that cover most, if not all aspects. There is one important disclaimer we want to make here though: as much as maintenance and responsiveness of developers matter, we evaluate software, not people. Here is what we came up with.</p><p><strong>Ease of use</strong> It’s difficult to design software that is compelling to both users who are new to solid parametric modeling and experienced users of competing products. However, it’s natural to expect a workbench that has a merit of its own and provides an obvious path to creating an assembly from start to finish, with as little friction as possible. We also expect the best workbench to be efficient in team work where parts can be submitted by different users and can be iterated upon.</p><p><strong>Consistency</strong> This is a multifaceted topic. Because FreeCAD is highly modular, developers have a lot of freedom in how they implement features. Ideally, the assembly workbench should follow roughly the same UI conventions as the rest of FreeCAD. This means that a user who is already familiar with designing parts with FreeCAD should have little-to-no problems figuring out how to make assemblies. Additionally,  an assembly workbench should function well with other workbenches, including add-on workbenches. For example, it should be able to work with enclosures designed with the SheetMetal workbench. It should conform to the same standards for translation and macro scriptability as other core workbenches.</p><p><strong>Features</strong> We are looking at the set of available constraints, how picking edges, faces and other features for alignment works, how imported parts can be managed in complex assemblies etc. However, having the most features doesn’t necessarily translate to the best user experience. A much better indication is how well a workbench serves the purpose it was designed for.</p><p><strong>Stability</strong> There are multiple factors at play when you evaluate stability of software. First, there’s the severity of issues. You can stumble upon a warning that doesn’t prevent you from accomplishing a task but is a mild annoyance. Or you can run into a crasher that loses unsaved changes or corrupts the model, which is a really bad user experience. This is not a problem for our evaluation: we can easily separate minor issues from crashers in reports.</p><p>Then there’s the number of users. If one workbench has 100 users and 10 unresolved crash reports, and another workbench has 10,000 users and also 10 unresolved bug reports, this likely means that the latter is more thoroughly tested and has less undiscovered issues. However, we have no way of knowing how many users each assembly workbench has. The amount of stars for a GitHub repository doesn’t sound like a fair way to judge on popularity, especially since visiting a GitHub repository is not how you install a FreeCAD workbench these days. We can get some sense of the user base from looking at how many unique users participated in discussing this or that assembly workbench on the forum. But this should be taken with a grain of salt as this approach doesn’t account for the part of users who stay in the shadows.</p><p>Also, reporting a bug should be simple enough. If it’s too difficult to do, that’s how you get bugs that continue to be unresolved for years, outside of developers’ radar. Fortunately, all four assembly workbenches are hosted on GitHub and thus have the same fairly sensible UX/UI for reporting bugs. That gives us some baseline.
Thus, given the limitations, we draw conclusions from unresolved stability issues reported to GitHub and relevant posts to the <a href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Forum</a>.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> Just like with stability, it’s hard enough to be a good judge of performance. Hardware specs vary wildly between users, and so does the complexity of assemblies. But if there is a significant amount of complaints about the performance in case of fairly simple assemblies (let’s say, 10 to 20 parts), something is obviously wrong.</p><p>There is one more aspect that we considered as well and ultimately decided against — code quality and extensibility. It is important to focus on the code that needs as little effort as possible to extend the feature set and maintain it. However, all four existing workbenches are between 7,600 and 14,900 lines of code. This is perfectly manageable in terms of time spent on potential refactoring. That said, having an engaged community grown around a particular workbench and willing to take action is a lot more important. You can do anything with an experienced, passionate team.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-now">What Now<a href="#what-now" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Now" title="Direct link to What Now">​</a></h3><p>In the next installments, we will evaluate <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Assembly2_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly2</a>, <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/A2plus_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A2plus</a>, <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Assembly3_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 3</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Assembly4_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 4</a> by the criteria explained above.

And if you’re in the job market and don’t have an active GitHub profile, you could be missing out on opportunities by overlooking FOSS.</p><h1>What you can actually judge from someone’s GitHub profile</h1><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-they-have-exposure-to-foss-at-all">Do they have exposure to FOSS at all?<a href="#do-they-have-exposure-to-foss-at-all" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Do they have exposure to FOSS at all?" title="Direct link to Do they have exposure to FOSS at all?">​</a></h3><p>First, we have to acknowledge the difference between hiring for a closed-source, proprietary product and open source software: If you’re a hiring manager for the former, basing your hiring decisions on someone’s OSS contributions is short sighted and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/11/16/hiring-based-on-open-source-contributions-could-be-harmful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could be harmful</a>. (And if you’re a candidate with no interest in working full time on FOSS, by all means, focus on your proprietary work instead.)</p><p>If however you’re in the business of FOSS, and you receive applications from one candidate with a GitHub account and one without, you are going to have a lot more to go on when assessing the first. I am always going to lean towards working with people who already engage with open source in some manner and are used to working transparently and engaging with a community. Having a GitHub account and forking even one project is the bare minimum someone can do to show they have experience here. Of course that’s going to influence my hiring.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-their-interests">What are their interests?<a href="#what-are-their-interests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are their interests?" title="Direct link to What are their interests?">​</a></h3><p>There are plenty of TikToks out there showing people how to optimize their resumes with keywords from the descriptions of jobs they’re applying for. It’s easy to stuff your CV with recruiter bait. Of course there are ways to uncover grifters in your hiring process. What is much harder to fabricate is a history of following open source projects, submitting issues, bug reports, and pull or merge requests, and engaging with communities. I’m looking for team members who share <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-01-ondsel-freecad-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my vision for making design tools accessible</a> and it’s much easier to establish whether someone cares about this mission if they’re following and interacting with related project.</p><p>If you’re hiring someone to do this kind of work on your project, you couldn’t ask for better signal than that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-they-collaborate-with-others">How do they collaborate with others?<a href="#how-do-they-collaborate-with-others" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do they collaborate with others?" title="Direct link to How do they collaborate with others?">​</a></h3><p>Beyond any code they contribute, a candidate who participates in OSS will have a history of code review, discussion, and engaging with feedback. Do they take suggestions on board, do they offer feedback and coaching to others? Sure, this requires a bit more attention than simply scanning a contribution graph, but it’s hard to replicate this kind of window into a candidate’s experience and conduct from interviews alone.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-they-have-something-to-offer-other-than-code">Do they have something to offer other than code?<a href="#do-they-have-something-to-offer-other-than-code" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Do they have something to offer other than code?" title="Direct link to Do they have something to offer other than code?">​</a></h3><p>Let’s revisit this idea of “updating a readme file” reflecting in someone’s GitHub graph. We’ll leave aside for now that they could automate updates using a cronjob or script (which, depending on the role you’re hiring for, could actually show the initiative and creativity that you’re looking for). Editing and updating documentation is a contribution that takes work and initiative, and we should encourage this too. Having non-programmers participate in your open source project is valuable and we only make it more intimidating when we assign greater value to code contributions than other activities that result in green squares.</p><h1>It’s never going to hurt to have a robust GitHub contribution history</h1><p>I got applications from the US, India, Ukraine, South Africa, France, Paraguay… all over.  I found it interesting that there was a stark difference between US applicants and international ones. Almost all of the international applicants had active GitHub accounts while perhaps 1 in 15 of the US ones did. There are many reasons why this might be, including a lack of exposure to open source at schools and institutions where FOSS is not widely adopted.</p><p>If you’re a jobseeker reading this and feeling like I’m suggesting you do <em>more work</em> because you aren’t active in open source yet, then the jobs I’m referring to are probably not for you. If the idea of participating in open source sounds burdensome, why would you seek out a full-time role in it anyway? If you are curious though, and want to give yourself the best chance of being considered seriously for work in FOSS, showing an active interest and engagement with projects is never going to hurt.</p><p>To help us make FreeCAD better and build the Ondsel product, consider <a href="https://ondsel.com/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joining us</a>.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.

It&#x27;s frequently cited as the number one reason holding back widespread adoption of FreeCAD for commercial use.</p><p>Developer <a href="https://github.com/realthunder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RealThunder</a> introduced <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=27278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a fix to the problem</a> years ago, but it has never been fully incorporated into the core product.</p><p>Will FreeCAD <em>ever</em> have a solution? Yes. But it’s going to take time.</p><p>Let’s back up a bit.</p><h1>What is topological naming, and why is it a problem in FreeCAD?</h1><p>Topological naming is the process of giving persistent names to elements of a solid model, such as faces, edges, and vertices. By naming these elements, we can attach features, dimensions, and other attributes to them.</p><p>The hard part of topological naming is making the names persistent even if the model is modified. Modern parametric designs are built up through a series of modifications which change the elements in the model. Faces may merge or be split. Edges may be chamfered, turning into multiple edges. If the computer is unable to maintain correct persistence of the naming—even when the underlying topology changes—the model breaks and recovery is difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/QSsVFu929jo?t=33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maker Tales has a good explanation here</a>.</p><p>The problem is ubiquitous in CAD. All applications suffer from it to some extent. The problem cannot be <em>solved</em> in the traditional sense. It can only be mitigated and most applications do a good job of avoiding the problem by either limiting the user’s actions or algorithmically tracking changes to the named features.</p><p>The current state of FreeCAD is weak in this regard. For simple models, the problem is fairly easy to avoid and a broken model is easy to repair. As models get more complicated, only a very disciplined approach to design will keep models intact. This requires experience that many new and casual users don’t have. That is why the problem is so frustrating—it bites you when you’ve already invested a lot of time learning the tool and building the design.</p><h1>RealThunder’s fix works. Why not use it?</h1><p>It seems obvious. We have a working branch of FreeCAD that isn’t plagued by the topological naming problem. Why wouldn’t we just merge it in and be done with it?</p><p>“The fact that this solvable topology naming problem is so serious yet so long-standing, tells me that this is really a people problem in the FreeCAD project. Because of this, as much as I want to use it, I simply can not afford this &quot;free&quot; software. The community needs to push out whomever is standing in the way of progress. And crowd-source some funds to hire a pro to fix the topology-naming issue as well as do some much-needed integration work.” — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSsVFu929jo&amp;lc=UgzY-2eximqNDrWgxkF4AaABAg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agnichatian on YouTube</a></p><p>This opinion is understandable and certainly not unusual. As much as we relate to the frustrations expressed here, it’s not as simple as just merging in RealThunder’s branch or bringing in one paid developer to do it once and for all. Why?</p><p>It’s important to appreciate how pervasive feature naming is within FreeCAD—or <em>any</em> CAD. Identifying features and attaching attributes to them is what modern parametric design is all about. Implementing a solution is not a straightforward task and implementing it incorrectly would cause user models to break irreparably. Even a <em>properly</em> implemented solution is guaranteed to have bugs and border-cases for a long time.</p><p>For all these reasons, the project leaders have chosen to move cautiously and to allow the solution to stabilize and be proven before merging it into the main branch.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-is-it-so-hard-to-merge">Why is it so hard to merge?<a href="#why-is-it-so-hard-to-merge" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why is it so hard to merge?" title="Direct link to Why is it so hard to merge?">​</a></h2><p>There are two factors:</p><p>First is the sheer size and number of code changes necessary to implement this solution. Many, if not most, files in FreeCAD need to be modified to incorporate the solution.
Second is the pace of other development work. The rest of FreeCAD’s development has only accelerated in recent years. Work is being done by many developers in many parts of the application.</p><p>Before new code can be merged, it has to be rebased onto the current version of source code. If there are conflicts, they have to be resolved manually. With a large, pervasive change like this, there are <em>always</em> conflicts. By the time rebasing is complete, the master branch has moved ahead and the process has to start again.</p><p>One solution could be to freeze the master branch and block any further changes until the topological naming solution is merged, but this might take many months to accomplish and just isn’t practical. There are many more features other developers are working on, and, more importantly, problems they are fixing. If we were to freeze the master branch in favor of one fix, other features will again have the same rebasing issue.</p><p>Of course, users could switch to using RealThunder’s branch exclusively. Some users who are particularly sensitive to the problem have done so successfully. For commercial users this may be hard to sell to leadership because RealThunder’s branch isn’t able to keep pace with the development of new features in the upstream FreeCAD application. They have to make a choice between relatively stable models and having access to the new and advanced features being developed throughout the rest of FreeCAD.</p><h1>What’s the path forward?</h1><p>At the FreeCAD Day meetup in Brussels in February 2023, Ondsel and other project leaders <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=658250#p658250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proposed a different strategy for resolving the issue</a>: Instead of attempting to merge RealThunder’s solution as a monolithic unit, we would, instead, consider it a proof-of-concept. The solution has been running in RealThunder’s LinksStage3 branch for two years and can be considered proven. Now we need to treat it as a roadmap to guide us towards implementing the solution in FreeCAD itself without disrupting current functionality or slowing down development.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="progress-without-regression">Progress without regression<a href="#progress-without-regression" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Progress without regression" title="Direct link to Progress without regression">​</a></h2><p>Rather than merging the code directly, our proposal is to break the code into functional pieces, each of which can be merged directly into the master branch without breaking the current functionality. This will require additional testing at each step and might require additional code to permit the merging without regression.</p><p>With this approach, each piece will be merged directly to master along with the relevant unit tests. This will avoid the need for a long-lived feature branch that requires constant rebasing.  There will be no single point where suddenly the problem is ‘fixed.’ Instead the necessary changes will be merged gradually and model stability will increase over time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="laying-the-foundation-for-long-term-change">Laying the foundation for long-term change<a href="#laying-the-foundation-for-long-term-change" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Laying the foundation for long-term change" title="Direct link to Laying the foundation for long-term change">​</a></h2><p>The first pieces to be merged may not provide any value to the end-user but will provide a solid foundation that later pieces can build on. As each piece is added, additional unit tests can be developed and better code conventions adopted for implementing the actual name resolution.</p><p>This path isn’t fast. It will take time and the collective expertise of many developers. It will take cooperation throughout the community and patience from our users.</p><h1>What is Ondsel’s role in all this? Is Ondsel going to solve the toponaming problem?</h1><p>Ondsel has already started a thorough survey of RealThunder’s solution in order to build a roadmap for integrating it.</p><p>Ondsel will help coordinate the change and will participate in delivering a resolution. We can bring professional engineering talent to the problem but we <em>cannot</em> do it alone. It will take time and the expertise of many software engineers across the community.</p><p>There’s no “one and done” fix, which means the FreeCAD development community needs broad institutional knowledge of the solution. The toponaming problem belongs to FreeCAD and, therefore, so must the solution.</p><p>For more context and to follow developments as we work on breaking down and gradually merging RealThunder’s fix, subscribe to <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/8432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GitHub issue</a>.</p><p>To help us make FreeCAD better and build the Ondsel product, consider <a href="https://ondsel.com/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joining us</a>.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.

Hobbyists, YouTubers, and makers felt betrayed. Now, after more than two years, we can see the effect. Many of those people left Fusion and never looked back.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>“	‘I have altered the deal. Pray I do not alter it further.’
— Darth Vader</p></blockquote><p>If that’s how you’re going to treat the hobbyists, then goodbye forever to Fusion 360.”

These changes felt like a slap in the face, with some members deleting their Fusion 360 accounts in protest (whether or not they were affected by the new limitations).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-proprietary-bait-and-switch">The proprietary bait and switch<a href="#the-proprietary-bait-and-switch" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The proprietary bait and switch" title="Direct link to The proprietary bait and switch">​</a></h3><p>The changes to the license for Fusion 360 for Personal Use were a perfect illustration of the risk of making use of “free as in beer” software. Many users felt betrayed and frustrated at the new limitations:</p><blockquote><p>“The file export limitations in particular are crippling. No .step? .dxf? No extensions??? I can&#x27;t even buy stress simulation credits? … yikes.”
— <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24496171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raynr on Hacker News</a></p></blockquote><p>Some users were not surprised, saying it was inevitable that the company would seek to monetize more of their product, even suggesting that the Fusion 360 license had been overly generous to begin with. This take undermines the exchange of benefits that takes place between vendors of free software and the communities that spring up around it:</p><p>“Think of the tens of millions of man-hours that have been invested into forum posts helping users, developing plugins, courses, YouTube videos, and Makerspace workshops that could have instead gone into making open source tools like KiCAD, OpenSCAD, pycam, etc better.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;All that work done by hobbyists, for free, helping Autodesk dominate the market in low-end CAD/CAM software.”

As one disappointed user commented:</p><p>“... you showed that you prefer to spend money to block existing features of your software instead of improving it with new paid features. That’s an indicator that you don’t care about the product itself anymore, but that you are just trying to extract the maximum money out of your current users instead.”— <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24498013" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streakycobra on Hacker News</a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-where-did-disgruntled-fusion-users-go">So where did disgruntled Fusion users go?<a href="#so-where-did-disgruntled-fusion-users-go" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So where did disgruntled Fusion users go?" title="Direct link to So where did disgruntled Fusion users go?">​</a></h3><p>Fusion users asked, “What can we use instead?” and the overwhelming sentiment was in favor of supporting free and open source projects that can’t be bought out or taken away.</p><p>As a longtime contributor to FreeCAD I was happy to see it suggested often.

While Ondsel’s product set is still being defined, my vision is to improve on the FreeCAD UI to make it more accessible for non-software engineers and build the collaborative features that small businesses and enterprises can benefit from—now with the resources of full-time development talent. With open core, the business model is to <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-01-open-core-standard-pricing-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monetize features based on who will use them</a>, with the core product remaining free and open to all. A strong core is integral to Ondsel’s success, as the core features are often an onramp for casual or hobby users who grow into businesses of their own and require different features as they scale. Having a solid and active open source ecosystem around it is vital to actually democratizing design for everyone.

That was an important milestone … and it passed with hardly anyone noticing. There was another important development last year and it barely got any more attention, even though it was far more consequential.</p><p>I&#x27;m referring to the creation of the FPA: FreeCAD Project Association. The FPA is a legal entity whose mission is to advance and protect the FreeCAD project. Besides being able to receive donations and pay for services, the FPA has a formal membership and decision making structure and this matters.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="freecad-is-changing">FreeCAD is changing<a href="#freecad-is-changing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to FreeCAD is changing" title="Direct link to FreeCAD is changing">​</a></h2><p>For many years the FreeCAD project operated as a loose confederacy of core developers.  Decisions were made by consensus. Development moved forward when someone had an itch to scratch and the project philosophy was, &quot;It&#x27;s done when it&#x27;s done.&quot; That kind of loose government served the project pretty well. Until it didn&#x27;t.</p><p>As the number of developers grew and the codebase got larger, consensus was harder to reach. Some problems defied consensus altogether. Too often, it felt like nobody was steering the ship. Many people wanted to see a clearer roadmap. They wanted leadership to address those thorny issues. Without a roadmap it was too risky for commercial companies to build around FreeCAD. Without leadership, there was no confidence that big problems would be addressed and industrial users were unwilling to adopt FreeCAD for mission-critical use.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introducing-the-fpa">Introducing the FPA<a href="#introducing-the-fpa" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introducing the FPA" title="Direct link to Introducing the FPA">​</a></h2><p>The FPA was launched with modest goals. The founders wanted to avoid a heavy-handed dictatorial style. They want to encourage the kind of collaboration and consensus that has made the project productive and fun for two decades. They also recognized that FreeCAD is maturing as a project and some formal structure is necessary. I was honored to be part of that process and deeply impressed with the wisdom and care that the founders took to balance these interests.</p><p>While the FPA is still finding its footing, it has already started taking steps that should have everyone excited.</p><p>First, the FPA has money and the willingness to fund development. With it, they can encourage focused effort in areas where organic interest hasn&#x27;t emerged.</p><p>Even more importantly, the FPA is working to get developers together in the same room. Zoom, email, and issue trackers are the tools we live with and they work well for day-to-day operations. But there&#x27;s nothing like face-to-face meetings for building trust, resolving conflict, and making long term plans. The ability to work face-to-face is one area where commercial development has a clear advantage over open source software. The FPA recognizes this and is taking steps to change it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="freecad-day-at-fosdem">FreeCAD Day at FOSDEM<a href="#freecad-day-at-fosdem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to FreeCAD Day at FOSDEM" title="Direct link to FreeCAD Day at FOSDEM">​</a></h2><p>The first ever &#x27;<a href="https://blog.freecad.org/2023/01/04/freecad-meeting-day-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Day</a>&#x27; will be held prior to FOSDEM on February 2, 2023. The day will be organized as an <em>unconference</em>. People attending the event will propose and decide what to do on premises.
