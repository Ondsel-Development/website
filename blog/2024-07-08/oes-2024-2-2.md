We’ve just released a bugfix update for the latest stable version of Ondsel Engineering Suite. The changes mostly affect users of the Assembly workbench, VarSets, and the Ondsel Lens addon.

<!-- truncate -->

Notable fixes:

* External linked subassemblies should work as expected now: links are recognized when creating joints and load properly (upstream issues [#14906](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/14906) and [#14907](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/14907)).
* Grounded parts cannot be dragged anymore (upstream issue [#14806](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/14806)).
* When you insert a component from parts you’ve just designed and saved, you will now see correct file names in the list of available components rather than ‘Unnamed.FCStd’ (upstream issue [#14684](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/14684)).
* Another Insert Component bug fixed: groups were appearing in the list even if they had no components to insert (upstream issue [#14933](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/14933)).
* Belt, Gear, and Rack and Pinion joints don’t crash FreeCAD anymore (upstream issue [#14458](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/14458)).
* The VarSet dialog now handles property types better. In particular, there’s now distinction between variable types that should not have an editor (editing values can be done in the property view) and types that are not supported, which are types that throw exceptions (upstream issue [#15156](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/15156)).
* The VarSet dialog shouldn’t be causing a segfault anymore when you change the name of a property (upstream issue [#15157](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/15157)).
* The Lens addon was patched for minor things: a max retries error was fixed, the login dialog was improved to work on Qt6, API headers were improved, creating share links was fixed.

Known issue: if you already had an earlier version of Ondsel ES installed, you will see a notification that a newer version of Ondsel Lens addon is available although we are shipping this release with the latest version already. This is because add-on installs from earlier versions are considered user modules, and user modules override system modules. In most cases, restarting Ondsel ES should fix the issue (the Lens addon automatically updates the local ‘user’ version), but in some cases you will need to manually update it.

You can get this new release [here](https://lens.ondsel.com/download-and-explore).

We are beginning to stabilize new features for the next larger release. So work is now focused on polishing both the upstream project and Ondsel-specific features.
