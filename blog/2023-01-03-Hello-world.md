Ondsel is Launched!

Technically, we started life at the beginning of January 2023.  The last few weeks have had us busy with the logistics of launching; Getting a website up, activating our internal tools, and figuring out how we fit into the greater FreeCAD ecosystem. Those details are done so it's time to start talking about the opportunity we have.

The best place to start is [OpenCoreVenture](https://opencoreventures.com/)'s official announcement [post about Ondsel](https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-01-ondsel-freecad-launch/)

In the coming weeks and months we'll use this blog to discuss where we're going and why we think it matters.  You can follow us here or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ondsel) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/ondsel)
We're also [building our team](../../careers) and looking for passionate and talented people.

Join Us!
