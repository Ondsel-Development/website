noreferrer">default assembly workbench</a> and then explored existing options: <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 2</a>, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A2plus</a>, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 3</a>, and <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 4</a>.</p><p>There are several more tools that provide a subset of their features, and these tools regularly come up in discussions on creating assemblies: the <a href="https://github.com/Freedman-CB1/BodyBuilder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BodyBuilder</a> macro, the <a href="https://github.com/easyw/Manipulator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manipulator</a> workbench, and the <a

We considered looking at the <a href="https://github.com/JMG1/ExplodedAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploded Assembly</a> workbench in this post, because creating such a view is a very common use case. However, after a quick study we found the following.</p><p>First of all, it’s done differently across available commercial CAD offerings. It’s a part of the assembly toolset in Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks, Siemens NX, Ansys SpaceClaim, and BricsCAD Mechanical. It’s an additional default tool in PTC Creo and Onshape. And it’s part of the animation feature set in Autodesk Inventor, Autodesk Fusion 360, and T-FLEX CAD. So there’s no one right way to do that.</p><p>In FreeCAD, there are at least two 3rd-party workbenches for animation that have tools for exploding an assembly, Exploded Assembly and <a href="https://github.com/microelly2/Animation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Animation</a>. Another workbench, <a href="https://github.com/Francisco-Rosa/FreeCAD-Movie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Movie</a>, suggests using a <a href="https://github.com/Francisco-Rosa/ExplodedAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fork</a> of the Exploded Assembly workbench. And there are <a href="https://jirivalasek.github.io/Animate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other workbenches</a> that deal with animating moving parts.</p><p>On one hand, this indicates that the FreeCAD community is leaning towards seeing this as part of the animation feature set. On the other hand, there are perfectly sensible use cases like technical illustrations where you might want to place an isometric view of an exploded assembly onto a TechDraw page, and that’s probably outside the animation workbench’s jurisdiction. So it makes sense to revisit this topic later when we can give it our full attention.</p><p>And now let’s get on with additional assembly-like tools.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bodybuilder-macro">BodyBuilder macro<a href="#bodybuilder-macro" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to BodyBuilder macro" title="Direct link to BodyBuilder macro">​</a></h2><p>According to the macro developer, ‘freedman’, the <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=5&amp;p=636992#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rationale</a> behind this project is this:</p><blockquote><p>I think many times new users and some of us need a model with just a few parts held together, we don&#x27;t need the full assembler that does everything <!-- -->[...]<!-- -->.</p></blockquote><p>Getting started with this tool can be a challenge.  There is no step-by-step tutorial. There’s a <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=72997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum thread</a> with a couple of GIFs and a few test files, only. Here is how it works.</p><p>The general idea is that, while the BodyBuilder macro is <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Macros" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">running</a>, you select an object in the viewport, then a sketch in the tree view. As soon as you do that, the object in the viewport gets centered at that sketch’s origin.</p><p>But the points in sketches that you align objects to don’t all sit at (0;0;0) exactly, typically they are all over the place. So what you do when you create a sketch is you start it at the origin and then you use the Position property in Attachment Offset to move the sketch in the three dimensions. Once you set it up, you can align a body to that sketch.</p><p>Doing that means that the body’s Position (Placement) value changes to the point in space defined by the sketch&#x27;s attachment offset.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="BodyBuilder macro running in FreeCAD" src="/assets/images/freecad-bodybuilder-viewport-ddde0a9329c548178e535b3d747aaa6c.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You have several options for what to do next when you want to move that object.</p><ul><li>You can use the Positioning menu of the macro to set a relative offset that will increment the absolute values.</li><li>You can set its position in absolute values, and for that the Properties dock is fairly sufficient.</li><li>Or you can use the on-canvas Transform tool.</li></ul><p>The macro has a kind of a menu, but really, it’s a different set of controls in generally the same space. The main menu allows looking at the reference sketch’s origin (has to be selected), setting X-Ray mode to the selected body to look through it, and switching to positioning settings. The positioning menu has offset, rotation etc. controls for the attached body. And the binding menu is where you initiate the binding of a body to a sketch or delete an existing binding.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="BodyBuilder macro menu structure" src="/assets/images/freecad-bodybuilder-menu-cc93e08e393c29a2e7fc350b717f86e0.webp" width="1364" height="1146" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Left to right: main menu, positioning menu, binding menu.</p><p>Once you get the hang of it, the macro works. It’s three clicks away if you have the Macro toolbar present, or a few more, if you have to use the menu. Workflow-wise, the main problem is repositioning the sketch origin, which takes some extra work. The trick is to open the macro menu, go to Positioning, double-click the sketch to start editing it, then add a point where the offset should be, enable the “Reposition Sketch origin” checkbox, then click on that newly added point. This will get you the desired attachment offset value.</p><p>So much like Assembly 4, BodyBuilder is built on top of existing core features, but it takes time to set everything up as compared to using constraints in Assembly 2/2+/3 workbenches.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-manipulator-workbench">The Manipulator workbench<a href="#the-manipulator-workbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Manipulator workbench" title="Direct link to The Manipulator workbench">​</a></h2><p>This workbench focuses on moving and aligning objects and does not allow creating permanent attachments with fixed degrees of freedom. The three major groups of tools are <em>Mover</em> tools, <em>Align</em> tools, and <em>Measure</em> tools. All three have floating palettes that can be docked.</p><p>The Mover toolset is how you move and rotate selected objects along the selected axis using numeric input. All changes are relative and affect the absolute position of the object: e.g. if your part is already shifted and rotated, further changes will increment existing displacement and rotation.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Mover tools in the Manipulator workbench" src="/assets/images/freecad-manipulator-mover-tools-3333fe850e825beb1ce472fc8d3729a2.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>If it wasn’t for the option to align the view to a selected face and then rotate around this custom axis, the entire set of Mover tools could be considered a duplication of the existing Placement functionality that allows to adjust absolute values with expressions.</p><p>The Align tools allow attaching objects by points, edges, centers, and planes to each other. The user has control over a number of options, such as:</p><ul><li>whether the bounding box or the center of mass of the reference object should be used;</li><li>whether the alignment normal is inverted;</li><li>which axis the object should be centered on (any combination is possible).</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Align tools in the Manipulator workbench" src="/assets/images/freecad-manipulator-align-tools-d51ee7c3a4a5ecf1ad96bcfd47a20c94.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>And then there’s the Measure tool that can get the radius of an arc or a circle, the length of an edge, the angle between two edges, and more. It works pretty much the same way as in other software: you need to select the first and the second elements when measuring distances between two objects or an angle between two edges. A single click on an arc or a circle will get you the radius, and a single click on an edge will get you its length. The extra label is optional and can be disabled.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Measure tools in the Manipulator workbench" src="/assets/images/freecad-manipulator-measure-tools-51aba437884566156314a9e1e1c0b83e.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This Measure tool has been modified and repurposed for the Assembly 4 workbench, so if you see similarities between them, this is not a coincidence.</p><p>The part of the feature set that deals with transforming and aligning objects has documentation and 3rd party video tutorials. Work with datum objects (points, lines, planes, LCSs), however, is entirely undocumented.</p><p>In a nutshell, despite its basic feature set and a certain overreliance on icons, the Manipulator workbench is a handy toolbox for making quick alignments. Moreover, the tools it provides are accessible in other workbenches like Sketcher, Part, and PartDesign. All you need to do is docking the floating palettes for your convenience.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="part-o-magic-workbench">Part-o-magic workbench<a href="#part-o-magic-workbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Part-o-magic workbench" title="Direct link to Part-o-magic workbench">​</a></h2><p>The main point of this workbench is saner automatic management of the project hierarchy. PoM plugs into the core of FreeCAD and makes sure that all new objects are added to the active container no matter what workbench is currently used.</p><p>But there are other features like autohiding all parts and bodies other than the one you are currently editing until you are done. Or duplicating objects, transferring them from one container to another, locating dependencies etc. All that has its use when working on complex assemblies, particularly with the top-down approach to designing.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The Part-o-magic workbench" src="/assets/images/freecad-part-o-magic-workbench-fd504301412e20da0f9e82b04515eb4f.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As FreeCAD starts gaining some of the features that PoM provides, the workbench is likely to grow obsolete.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>The main takeaway from exploring BodyBuilder and Manipulator is that there is a demand for making quick attachments of a small number of parts. So further work on a default assembly workbench should include research focusing on two things. First of all, it’s useful to understand the exact reasons people try to avoid using full-blown assembly workbenches for such tasks. Given that the UX/UI of BodyBuilder and Manipulator are not particularly easier than those of all assembly workbenches we reviewed earlier, this has to do either with project hierarchy, or with using constraints and solvers, or both. Secondly, the future default assembly workbench should be designed in a way that would keep the workflow lightweight and straightforward for these “simple” use cases.</p><p>As for Part-o-magic, some of the tools, like the deep copy of containers, look like features that belong to upstream FreeCAD.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-up">Next Up<a href="#next-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next Up" title="Direct link to Next Up">​</a></h2><p>We are concluding the series. In the next post, we will summarize our findings, as well as the takeaways from the public discussion, and suggest a way forward.	</p><p>In the previous posts in this series we’ve already discussed reasons to create a <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">default assembly workbench</a> and then explored existing options: <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 2</a>, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A2plus</a>, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 3</a>, and <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 4</a>.</p><p>There are several more tools that provide a subset of their features, and these tools regularly come up in discussions on creating assemblies: the <a href="https://github.com/Freedman-CB1/BodyBuilder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BodyBuilder</a> macro, the <a href="https://github.com/easyw/Manipulator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manipulator</a> workbench, and the <a href="https://github.com/DeepSOIC/Part-o-magic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part-o-magic</a> workbench.

Zolko came to the community with extensive knowledge of other CAD programs such as Pro/E, Catia, and T-Flex, but he was very (and probably needlessly) humble about his programming skills.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Assembly 4 commits" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-4-commits-03bf4b69f69316fe72612d0958b6db0d.png" width="1760" height="557" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Just like with other assembly workbenches, much of the development has been affected by the user community, and a number of features have been contributed by other developers. So far, A4 is the only assembly workbench where the development pace is about the same as it was when the project started, and Zolko isn’t done yet.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workflow-and-ease-of-use">Workflow and ease of use<a href="#workflow-and-ease-of-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use" title="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use">​</a></h2><p>Assembly 4 relies on several core principles.</p><p>First off, it is built around the <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/App_Link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App:Link API</a> that we already mentioned in previous posts in the series. In a nutshell, rather than creating a full copy of a part, FreeCAD will reference it. This makes models cleaner, and you always work with up-to-date geometry. The workbench also has the concept of a variant link which allows referencing the same object multiple times and using different parameters for each of the linked instances.</p><p>Secondly, rather than aligning characteristics of two parts (e.g. vertex to vertex), the workbench maps one local coordinate system (LCS) to another. Each body in a part can have multiple local coordinate systems. For example, the part on the screenshot below has 5 of them:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Multiple LCSs in a part" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-4-multiple-lcs-12ec72cd93b2bf559c95885d3e675868.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>When an LCS is originally created, it is attached to a very specific feature of a part. However, if the geometry of that part changes, the LCS stays where it was. Which makes it unaffected by the dreaded toponaming issue (now being finally taken care of in upstream FreeCAD). The kind of a feature an LCS is attached to defines what attachment options are available.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Picking features to attach an LCS to" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-4-picking-features-for-lcs-7e5f1da6734e29ce645cf0dbed702135.png" width="1840" height="1205" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Then when a new part is inserted into an assembly, the user specifies the parent part (which part to attach to), the source LCS (from the newly inserted part), and the target LCS (from the parent part):</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Mapping LCSs in Assembly 4" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-4-mapping-lcs-33e202f441562b00ea16e8c3b7dbbf17.png" width="1584" height="886" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Once both LCSs are aligned, all six degrees of freedom are fixed, and thus parts stay attached no matter what. It is, however, possible to “release” a DOF by using the attachment offset property and expressions.</p><p>We’ve seen multiple testimonials that the approach to assembling a model through LCS proves to be more predictable and robust. </p><p>On the flip side, the process of setting all LCSs is rather tedious, and attaching one part to another means you have to make more clicks than what you typically get with regular constraints.</p><p>Finally, Assembly 4 supports both <a href="https://caeuniversity.com/bottom-up-and-top-down-approach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top-down and bottom-up</a> design models. We do need to point out though that with the bottom-up approach, it is impossible to insert a part from an external file without opening it as a document.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features">Features<a href="#features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Features" title="Direct link to Features">​</a></h2><p>Because of how the workflow is implemented, Assembly 4 doesn’t have rows and rows of buttons to go through when you need to align one part with another. A large part of the feature set is about managing your assembly: creating new bodies and groups, inserting parts (there’s also a simple integration with the Fasteners workbench), mapping LCSs to each other etc. Apart from LCS, A4 allows creating more datum types: plane, axis, and point. Internally, those are all PartDesign objects.</p><p>A4 comes with its own tools for creating mirrored, linear, and circular arrays, as well as a measure tool:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Measure tool" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-4-measure-tool-a465016615cbcb387ba57a1decfebecb.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For animation, Assembly 4 uses variables and <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Expressions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expressions</a>. For example, if you need to rotate a part, what you do is create a new variable and set it e.g. to 0, then use that variable in the <em>Angle</em> placement property of your part, then open the animation dialog, select the variable to animate, set min and max values to feed into the variable, as well as the increment value, and run the animation.  </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Animation in Assembly 4" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-4-animation-b5757dd5ee22b5359e5f2b0c9551739e.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Theo Janssen’s <a href="https://www.strandbeest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strandbeest</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Examples/tree/master/Asm4_Tutorial4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">model by Zolko</a> (CC0-1.0 license) </p><p>The implementation is somewhat technical, but it works. The downside of all this is that due to the incomplete multithreading support in FreeCAD you can’t really stop the animation until the current cycle is over. Unfortunately, while animation does the trick in some cases, collision detection would still be really useful.</p><p>Despite the initial idea to not use a solver that got the entire Assembly 4 adventure going, Zolko did end up creating a solver to recompute all the links and placements in an assembly. In fact, as user ‘aapo’ <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=670464#p670464" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained in a recent discussion</a>, A4 has <em>multiple</em> solvers and can use custom external ones. Even more, there’s a branch called <a href="https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Assembly4/compare/master...solver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘solver’</a> waiting to be completed and merged. It brings the A2plus solver to Assembly 4.</p><p>The workbench has good if somewhat scattered documentation. There are <a href="https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Assembly4/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instructions</a> for new users that explain features, basic concepts, and workflow. There are also <a href="https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several tutorials</a> written by the principal developer in a dedicated GitHub repository. And some of the user documentation is in the <a href="https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Assembly4/tree/master/Examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Examples</a> folder of the main GitHub repository.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consistency">Consistency<a href="#consistency" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Consistency" title="Direct link to Consistency">​</a></h2><p>Assembly 4 does nearly everything in dialogs in the Combo View, which is a fairly standard practice. No surprises there.</p><p>The workbench can work with parts created by other assemblies, although in our testing it seems like a good idea creating local coordinate systems in those parts prior to inserting them for simplicity’s sake.</p><p>There have been <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=10&amp;t=40363" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a number of problems</a> getting A4 to work well with the TechDraw workbench. Most of them reportedly have been fixed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stability">Stability<a href="#stability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stability" title="Direct link to Stability">​</a></h2><p>From the Issues section on GitHub and the forum it appears that Assembly 4 is very stable. Users mostly have problems with the <a href="https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Assembly4/blob/master/Examples/ConfigBOM/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill of Materials</a> feature (there have been <a href="https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Assembly4/pull/403" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent fixes</a> to address some of the issues). In our limited testing, A4 crashed a few times — mostly, when editing datum objects. The number of actual bug reports (rather than feature requests) on GitHub is very low (just 1 as of March 27). However, a number of bugs are known and reported to the forum.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="performance">Performance<a href="#performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Performance" title="Direct link to Performance">​</a></h2><p>We found some complaints about A4 being slow with complex assemblies. One workaround that appears to improve the situation is disabling the preselection highlight (Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Display &gt; Colors).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development-status">Development Status<a href="#development-status" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development Status" title="Direct link to Development Status">​</a></h2><p>Assembly 4 is an active project with a growing share of new contributors. There have been multiple tagged releases, and the latest internal version update was in February 2023.
Collectively, the community around Assembly 4 keeps the number of pull requests to an absolute minimum (just 3 open out of 245 ever submitted, as of March 27). Zolko responds to most of the bug reports within a day or two, although fixing some of the bugs may take longer than that.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>Assembly 4 relies on local coordinate systems to attach parts to each other. The workbench is fairly robust, there are very few severe issues reported by users. However, the LCS approach — as implemented in A4 — is low-level and implies a somewhat tiresome process of setting everything up.</p><p>The project has a small active team of contributors who keep the amount of unresolved issues and unmerged patches as low as possible. We also found the user community to be really enthusiastic and passionate about the project.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-up">Next up<a href="#next-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next up" title="Direct link to Next up">​</a></h2><p>In the next installment, we’ll take a slight detour and explore several assembly-like solutions: the Manipulator and Part-o-Magic workbenches, as well as the BodyBuilder macro.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/development">development</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/assembly">assembly</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/assembly-4">assembly4</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-31d5663f356c89f6034ea0e0d24a94c1.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/default-assembly-workbench-4">Exploring the Assembly 3 workbench</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-03-23T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">March 23, 2023</time> · <!-- -->9 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/prokoudine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57467?v=4" alt="Alexandre Prokoudine"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/prokoudine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Alexandre Prokoudine</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Contributing Writer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is the fourth part in the series where we explore the possibility of creating a default assembly workbench for FreeCAD. We started out with a <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conversation</a> about why we need a default assembly workbench in the program, then <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviewed Assembly 2</a> and <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A2plus</a>. Now let’s talk about the Assembly 3 workbench.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="history">History<a href="#history" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to History" title="Direct link to History">​</a></h2><p>In 2013, Jonathan Westhues took the FOSS community by surprise releasing the source code of <a href="https://solvespace.com/index.pl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SolveSpace</a>, his parametric 2D/3D CAD software built around a very capable custom solver. Some 4 years later, Zheng Lei aka “realthunder” created a Python binding for the solver, then used it to create his own assembly workbench for FreeCAD.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Commit to Assembly 3 over time" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly3-commits-74dd6007bd2a4cd50c76d386f0c5e1dd.png" width="1761" height="554" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Further changes in the workbench required <a href="https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patching FreeCAD</a>, so realthunder created a friendly fork of the entire program, which over time became his primary project with many other changes and add-ons not available in upstream FreeCAD by default: the pie menu, transparent docks, and others.</p><p>Some of the architectural changes have already been merged to upstream FreeCAD, others are getting there. The Assembly 3 workbench continues to be maintained and is available to users of upstream FreeCAD as an addon and is now part of this larger project, the ‘LinkStage’ fork.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workflow-and-ease-of-use">Workflow and ease of use<a href="#workflow-and-ease-of-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use" title="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use">​</a></h2><p>Assembly 3 is substantially different from other assembly workbenches in multiple aspects. Here are some of its most significant characteristics.</p><p><strong>Project hierarchy.</strong> In A3, an assembly consists of constraints, elements, and parts. Elements are the features of parts that are used to create a constraint, e.g. a point of one part and a plane of another part. Assemblies can contain sub-assemblies, in which case each sub-assembly will carry its own set of constraints, elements, and parts. This approach makes navigating a complex project fairly straightforward.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Project hierarchy in Assembly 3" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly3-project-hierarchy-f069e78b9d5c0571aba74ae9865e8535.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><a href="https://github.com/Nemesis81/GraberI3_Freecad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graber I3 model by Nemesis81</a></p><p><strong>Top-down design model.</strong> This approach is technically available in A2 and A2plus, but it is not a recommended way of using those workbenches. Assembly 3 makes the top-down design model a first-class citizen. You can create new parts, then drag them into the Parts section of the project tree, then they will become usable in the assembly.</p><p><strong>Bottom-up design model.</strong> This is likely how most A3 users approach creating assemblies. The workbench provides two ways to build an assembly from parts saved as external files: importing from STEP files or linking (see below) FreeCAD projects that are already opened in the program.</p><p><strong>Links.</strong> A3 is not the only assembly workbench to rely on the <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/App_Link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App::Link API</a> to reference objects instead of copying them, Assembly 4 also does it. But A3 is what this API was designed for in the first place. The general idea is that if you have e.g. 4 screws of the same type to fix a motherboard to a plastic box, you don’t need 4 instances of the same screw geometry. You only need one part that you can reuse via links.</p><p>Creating a link, however, is all not at all obvious and requires performing a particular sequence of actions: selecting a part (Body object) in the project tree, then selecting an assembly document in the document tabs, then clicking a Link button in the toolbar. Figuring this out without reading documentation or watching a tutorial or asking on the forum is all but impossible.</p><p><strong>Fixing parts and freezing sub-assemblies.</strong> While fixing a part in A2plus is a property of a part, the A3 approach is to select a feature and assign a “Locked” constraint to it to eliminate all or some degrees of freedom (this depends on the type of the selected feature). The idea of locking something entirely goes even further. When working on a complex assembly, a particularly useful way to simplify computations is to freeze a sub-assembly. Such a sub-assembly is considered fixed by the solver and is therefore excluded from update calculations.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features">Features<a href="#features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Features" title="Direct link to Features">​</a></h2><p>Assembly 3 is the most feature-packed of all existing assembly WBs. It comes with over 40 constraint types, various helper tools, means to control workplanes, and more. It also has a dynamic solver, so you can move parts under constraints.</p><p>The workbench does its best to keep track of degrees of freedom to avoid overconstraining an assembly. However, in doing so, it doesn’t make it easy to indicate where the problem is exactly. All it does is notifying the user that there are inconsistent constraints. It is up to the user to locate the offensive elements and constraints.</p><p>There are more caveats. In particular, the vast amount of features in this workbench raises the expectations for UX/UI. Assembly 3 has an overwhelming UI. It comes with no less than six toolbars, three out of which are different groups of constraints.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Assembly 3 toolbars" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly3-toolbars-d58f25c6ecc6f4d694d53caa0a082150.png" width="1499" height="214" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>There’s the main constraints group and two additional groups of constraints. This takes a lot of getting used to. We’ve seen experienced users of the workbench making really useful elaborate tutorials about it and yet failing to locate the constraint they need on the first attempt.</p><p>Things don’t get much better with the <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/ModernUI_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ModernUI</a> add-on that creates a Ribbon-like top toolbar. You get readable labels (something the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jef Raskin</a> would appreciate), but you also get a large scrollable area:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Assembly 3 with a Ribbon-like toolbar" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly3-with-ribbon-like-ui-b2272e0aaf11cb3df1e2d74cc428d4cc.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><a href="https://github.com/Nemesis81/GraberI3_Freecad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graber I3 model by Nemesis81</a></p><p>Assembly 3 is not uniquely complex here. Arch, FEM, TechDraw, and a few other workbenches also have a similar or even larger amount of UI to deal with. This suggests that there may be a need for a general UX/UI review and a better strategy for organizing the user interface and designing the interaction — something that would be solved on the core level and then propagated to all workbenches, default and 3rd-party alike.</p><p>Three sorely missing features are collision detection, visual control over degrees of freedom, and the generation of BOM. Collision detection was <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=253170#p253170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planned</a> back in 2018, the idea was to use the <a href="https://pybullet.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bullet</a> physics engine, but this hasn’t materialized yet. Regarding DOF control, it is virtually impossible to find out how many degrees of freedom a part has without trial-and-error by attempting to transform it and — sometimes — looking at the output log in the built-in console (A2plus solves that by optionally displaying an indicator for each part in the viewport). And as for BOM, realthunder already <a href="https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Expression-and-Spreadsheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explored in detail</a> the requirements for developing BOM generation two years ago, but there is no code yet.</p><p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Assembly3_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wiki page</a> for the assembly at FreeCAD’s website provides some basic documentation on features, and the project’s <a href="https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">own wiki</a> explores basic concepts of A3 and provides several tutorials. However, neither can serve as a reference guide, hence finding out what some of the features do will require original research by users. Notably, there’s a lot of YouTube tutorials on using Assembly 3.

However, this cannot be used as a sole indicator of the maintainer’s responsiveness: for some reason, it’s fairly common for users to report bugs associated with FreeCAD itself rather than with the workbench in question. Given that the ‘Linkstage’ fork of FreeCAD also has over 300 unresolved bug reports and feature requests, this is obviously too much for one person to handle, even though he gets some help with triaging reports.</p><p>None of the currently open bug reports are crash reports for the Assembly 3 workbench. Having said that, we did experience a few random crashes when working with the WB. We also looked at workbench crashes reported in the past and found that realthunder pays a lot of attention to that and typically fixes those within several days.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="performance">Performance<a href="#performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Performance" title="Direct link to Performance">​</a></h2><p>While it’s possible to exclude sub-assemblies from computation by freezing them and thus saving the resources for when they are needed, this will not be sufficient in all use cases. With complex assemblies (over a hundred parts), A3 can become really slow. </p><p>Moreover, even in simple use cases (two parts, two constraints), Assembly 3 will often fail to perform an axial rotation smoothly with 1 DOF left, while the rotation increment is as small as 1°.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development-status">Development Status<a href="#development-status" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development Status" title="Direct link to Development Status">​</a></h2><p>Although there have been contributions from at least a dozen more people, realthunder remains the author of 92% of all commits to the workbench since project’s inception. The project is maintained, however its active development phase ended in 2019. The last workbench release was tagged in 2020 and the latest internal version is 0.11.4 from November 2022. We also found that the development remains uncoupled from the upstream SolveSpace project: multiple changes and new features related to constraints appear to have never made its way to the workbench.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="legal-status">Legal Status<a href="#legal-status" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Legal Status" title="Direct link to Legal Status">​</a></h2><p>Because Assembly 3 relies on a fork of SolveSpace’s source code, it’s available under the terms of GPLv3+. This makes its inclusion in the FreeCAD application problematic. Thus the workbench can only be installed separately in upstream FreeCAD as an addon.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>Assembly 3 is substantially more advanced than either A2 or A2plus workbenches: generally better workflow, better support for bottom-up design, better-designed project hierarchy, vastly more constraint options, and the list goes on. The project also has an avid user community and the developer is typically fast to respond to reports of severe bugs.</p><p>At the same time, A3 has a number of usability issues and important missing features such as BOM generation. The solver’s license also makes this workbench an unlikely choice for a foundation of a potential default workbench in FreeCAD.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-up">Next up<a href="#next-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next up" title="Direct link to Next up">​</a></h2><p>Now that we’ve explored Assembly 3, we are getting closer to the end of the series.

Now let’s get into the nitty-gritty of the A2plus workbench.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="history">History<a href="#history" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to History" title="Direct link to History">​</a></h2><p>A FreeCAD user kbwbe started working on this project in 2018 following <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=1&amp;t=29207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experiments</a> with a new solver developed on top of the pre-existing Assembly 2 workbench:</p><blockquote><p>I developed a small prototype of yet another solver. It is in a very early state now and is only capable of handling plane/circularedge/axis-constraints. But it can easily be extended. It consists only of one file, which is attached. The base concept is inspired by physics. <!-- -->[...]<!-- --> It is just a prototype and many things are still missing. But the idea seems to work. I am working with a refurbished assembly2-workbench. I like the base concepts of it very much and did some bigger projects with it. </p></blockquote><p>Having received initial feedback, kbwbe created a <a href="https://github.com/kbwbe/A2plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public repository</a> on GitHub and continued hacking on the new workbench publicly.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Commits History for the A2plus Workbench" src="/assets/images/freecad-a2plus-wb-commits-9185649cf50276951e2453253a69253b.png" width="1758" height="558" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Despite an activity plunge during the pandemic, A2plus is still being actively developed and receives new features and bug fixes.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workflow-and-ease-of-use">Workflow and ease of use<a href="#workflow-and-ease-of-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use" title="Direct link to Workflow and ease of use">​</a></h2><p>A2plus follows the same general idea as its predecessor: create parts as separate files, align them with constraints, solve. Just like Assembly 2, this workbench supports sub-assemblies.
There are some differences though. The one that stands out immediately is that, rather than creating one constraint object in the project tree, A2plus creates references to the same constraint in both involved parts.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A2plus Constraints in the Project Tree" src="/assets/images/freecad-a2plus-constraints-in-project-tree-77a47f6284ea3000322cdf7feff1d058.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Another difference is that a part in A2plus is a special type of an object. So it’s possible to create a new part from within the workbench and fill it with objects e.g. in the Part Design workbench. But the part will have to be manually converted to an A2plus part to become usable in the workbench. The caveat here is that even then such a part will not be added to the BOM: only the parts imported from external files will be displayed there. Overall, the top-down design approach is not favored by A2plus, as earlier <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=1&amp;p=265666#p265666" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted by kbwbe</a> in the FreeCAD forum:</p><blockquote><p>Leaving PartDesign bodies within the assembly is not the intended workflow. Best way is to import everything. Converting is also not the preferred way. Even all parametrics of the parts get lost.</p></blockquote><p>Unlike Assembly 2, the A2plus workbench can also load user-selected objects from another FreeCAD project. In this case, the workbench will reference the object from the file, so FreeCAD will pick any changes made to the original project when you click the Update button.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Importing Objects from a FreeCAD Project File" src="/assets/images/freecad-a2plus-load-objects-from-fc-file-b0059d99f66a4072ebd2a1577442fcc7.png" width="1234" height="829" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In terms of general user experience, A2plus is a major improvement over Assembly 2. Here are some examples of user-visible changes:</p><ul><li>When features (points, planes etc.) of multiple parts are selected, the workbench automatically makes available only the constraints that can be used with these features. This removes a lot of guesswork for new users.</li><li>Imported parts can easily be opened for editing as separate documents. All edited parts then can be updated with a single click.</li><li>When cleaning up an assembly, it’s possible to easily delete all constraints associated with a part.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features">Features<a href="#features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Features" title="Direct link to Features">​</a></h2><p>The workbench has a respectable set of constraints: Point-to-Point, Point-on-Line, Point-on-Plane, Sphere-to-Sphere, Circular-Edge, Axis-to-Axis, Axis-to-Plane, Axis-Plane-Normal, Angular Axis-to-Plane, Planes-Parallelism, Planes-Coincident, Angled-Planes, Center-of-Mass. This covers a variety of use cases.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Constraints Available in A2plus" src="/assets/images/freecad-a2plus-constraint-options-136c354eb13a807fb6c2c41bbbb20675.png" width="1857" height="1085" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>A2plus comes with an autosolver. The way it works, however, is somewhat unreliable. Case in point: select two planes, create a Plane-Coincident constraint, solve, accept. Then select the constraint and change its Offset parameter in the Combo View. The autosolver will not update the position of the object that has the first plane, you will have to click the Solve button for this change to take effect.</p><p>There’s a number of convenience features specific to A2plus (as compared to Assembly 2) such as placing labels on parts in the viewport for easier navigation or making parts’ fills transparent.
The behavior of A2plus is configurable. Settings are available in the Preferences dialog:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A2plus Preferences" src="/assets/images/freecad-a2plus-wb-preferences-aabfacf6943b50156010c4255d5892e9.png" width="1612" height="1004" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Some features of the original Assembly 2 workbench are unavailable. Notably, the animation of the assembly for collision analysis is missing.</p><p>The A2plus workbench has a good <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/A2plus_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reference guide</a> on FreeCAD’s wiki but lacks official tutorials that explain the workflow. The community, however, stepped up and provided a sufficient number of YouTube tutorials on using A2plus for a variety of use cases: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI4trcyFwvs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mechanical design</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIv15hX6Isw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">woodworking</a>, etc.</p><p><strong>Update 2023-03-26:</strong> There is at least <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=46024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one documented case</a> where the precision of the A2plus solver was not sufficient to get the job done. The workbench developer <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=395617#p395617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> this by having to find a compromise between speed (responsiveness of the WB) and accuracy due to limited calculation power available to a solver written in Python.<sup id="fnref-1-869403"><a href="#fn-1-869403" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consistency">Consistency<a href="#consistency" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Consistency" title="Direct link to Consistency">​</a></h2><p>A2plus does a few things differently from many other workbenches. The most user-visible difference is how constraint settings are displayed. When a new constraint is being added, FreeCAD displays a floating dialog:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Constraint Properties in A2plus" src="/assets/images/freecad-a2plus-wb-constraint-settings-5e2a1276923b19a0cd25fbee770e8540.png" width="1347" height="539" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Double-clicking the constraint in the project tree reopens this floating dialog. However, the very same information is displayed in the Combo View. So there’s two competing approaches to editing settings of a constraint.</p><p>Similarly, the first button in the Constraint toolbar opens another floating window that duplicates the list of constraints that is already available in that toolbar. This is not a common (although fairly optional-to-use) UI solution for FreeCAD.</p><p>As already noted, some objects require a conversion to an A2plus part, like the basic 3D objects created in the Part workbench. At the same time, this assembly workbench has no problem working with parts created in e.g. SheetMetal WB.</p><p>One important caveat of A2plus is that it doesn’t use the standard <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/App_Link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App::Link</a> machinery to reference objects in other documents. Parts added to the document this way cannot be used in an assembly. </p><p>Some actions, like adding a part from an external file are not correctly added to the undo buffer so they cannot be reverted in the normal way.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stability">Stability<a href="#stability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stability" title="Direct link to Stability">​</a></h2><p>As of publishing this overview, there are no reported crashers that aren’t fixed. There haven’t even been many before: the issue tracker only lists 3 bugs in A2plus that ever crashed FreeCAD, and git log likewise lists only a few fixes for crashes. However, we were able to crash the program by pressing Ctrl+Z to undo while moving a part under constraints.</p><p>The main developer typically responds to bug reports within the first few days. There’s a small number of bug reports with mild severity from 2019 where either no detailed information was provided by the reporter, or the developer couldn’t replicate the issue, or the report slipped through developer’s fingers. The workbench occasionally exhibits inconsistent or glitchy behavior like failing to delete a conflicting constraint. Other than that, nothing particularly bad stands out.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="performance">Performance<a href="#performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Performance" title="Direct link to Performance">​</a></h2><p>Assemblies are inherently complex beasts. It takes a substantial amount of talent, time, and effort to make a fast solver — a combination that not every volunteer has at their disposal. We’ve definitely seen complaints like <a href="https://www.hobby-machinist.com/threads/freecad-assembly-a2plus-v0-4-54b.97301/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a> about performance issues in the A2plus workbench even with fairly simple assemblies. However, in our limited testing, we were unable to come up with conclusive evidence for assemblies “blowing up” after changes. Simple assemblies (up to 40 parts) did not represent a major issue for A2plus. But there was noticeable rendering slowdown when moving parts under constraints.</p><p>At least one of the reasons for possible performance issues according to the main A2plus developer is the inefficient use of memory. This is how he <a href="https://github.com/kbwbe/A2plus/issues/378#issuecomment-612878010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explains</a> it and goes on to give very useful hints about ways a programmer could deal with Python limitations:</p><blockquote><p>Memory management using Python as a programming language is not that easy and some memory leaks cannot be completely avoided. Python is keeping a lot of internal lists, which are immortal and their memory is not given back to the system during the lifetime of the program. So it is not possible to delete no more used objects from memory directly, as it is possible with &quot;C/C++&quot;. Every object, which is not used anymore, is deleted (or sometimes it is not for various reasons), from Python&#x27;s garbage collector.
The code can only be optimized in order to reduce memory consumption. (using slots, avoiding string concatenation etc). I will have a look at this next time, where it is possible. But this is a bunch of work and will need a lot of time. And it will never be perfect.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development">Development<a href="#development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development" title="Direct link to Development">​</a></h2><p>The main developer responds to proposed contributions rather fast: many PRs by drive-by contributors are merged within days of submission, sometimes on the same day. Just 1 out of 452 pull requests is sitting unapplied on GitHub.</p><p>In the fall of 2022, a new regular contributor joined the project. His activity now rivals that of kbwbe.</p><p>Unlike with the original Assembly 2 workbench that had zero releases, the main developer of A2plus regularly tagged releases until November 2022 (a total of 101 tags so far). Releases mostly represent one or two bug fixes.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="community">Community<a href="#community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Community" title="Direct link to Community">​</a></h2><p>A2plus has one of the longest dedicated threads in the forum. However, since 2021, the activity of discussions has noticeably decreased: just 16 messages in the main thread in 2021, and 12 messages in 2022. The reason for this is unclear but might indicate that the interest towards the workbench has been decreasing as users move to other options.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>A2plus represents a major improvement over the original Assembly 2 workbench in terms of both workflow, features, and usability. It has more types of constraints, more convenience features, and better supports single-user workflows. It’s also sufficiently stable and has two developers who actively merge patches from other contributors. At the same time, the workbench has some unconventional UX/UI solutions and is reportedly prone to performance issues that are not easily resolved.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-up">Next up<a href="#next-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next up" title="Direct link to Next up">​</a></h2><p>In the next installment, we’ll take a close look at Assembly 3, a workbench that actively uses a solver from another free/libre CAD program, SolveSpace.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.

It will read both FreeCAD, OBJ, IGES, and STEP files. The workbench expects that the user either enables the visibility of just one body in the design file or creates files with single-body parts. Sub-assemblies are possible, however.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graber I3 model by Nemesis81" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-2-01-500fa911f5bf96ffd089c232695b49b8.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q">

Imported parts can be manually updated when the linked original file changes. Overall, it’s a straightforward workflow: import multiple parts from respective files, select parts’ features, add constraints, solve, done.</p><p>Problems begin to arise when a change is required. Assembly 2 does not have a dynamic solver. So once you change something like a distance or an angle, you have to create a constraint anew. Moreover, only some features in the workbench support undo/redo.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features">Features<a href="#features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Features" title="Direct link to Features">​</a></h3><p>Constraints available in Assembly 2 are limited to circular edge, plane, axial, angular (for planes), and spherical surface. There are a few tools to work with constraints like flipping their directions.</p><p>Once constraints are done and solved, you can animate degrees of freedom to check for clearances and collisions in any combination of their respective positions. Additionally, it’s possible to check the entire assembly for overlapping parts.</p><p>Assembly 2 also allows creating a list of parts, for which it uses the <a href="https://github.com/hamish2014/FreeCAD_drawing_dimensioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drawing Dimensioning</a> workbench by the same original developer. Which, in return, only works with page objects created with the Drawing workbench. It’s also possible to create one object from all or just the selected parts in an assembly to display them in a drawing. Notably, the <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Drawing_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drawing</a> workbench is now deprecated and replaced by the <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/TechDraw_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechDraw</a> workbench.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consistency">Consistency<a href="#consistency" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Consistency" title="Direct link to Consistency">​</a></h3><p>The way the user interface is organized is in line with the rest of FreeCAD. However, for people new to assemblies, watching a few tutorials on YouTube will be really helpful. Unfortunately, the documentation on the workbench in the FreeCAD’s wiki is scarce: it only lists available features and doesn’t provide any information on them that you wouldn’t be able to see in the tooltips of the actual user interface.</p><p>Assembly 2 can work with parts created in other workbenches like <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/SheetMetal_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SheetMetal</a> or parts created with ‘importer’ workbenches like <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/KicadStepUp_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KiCadStepUp</a> or <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Fasteners_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fasteners</a>. However, because it demands just one body to be visible in an imported project and does not allow choosing which body to import, placing an entire board into an enclosure will require a lot of time and patience.</p><p>The workbench also doesn’t follow the more recent trend of making 3rd party workbenches translatable.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graber I3 model by Nemesis81" src="/assets/images/freecad-assembly-2-02-d34cd09ae326623400b361eed672fa01.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q">

So there’s no aggregated information on bugs and their severity. When used with a recent version of FreeCAD, the workbench has various glitches. The general recommendation appears to be keeping a copy of an older FreeCAD version (typically, v0.16 or v0.17) around to open old files that use this assembly workbench. For new users, the recommendation is to try one of the newer assembly workbenches.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="performance">Performance<a href="#performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Performance" title="Direct link to Performance">​</a></h3><p>Despite its simplicity, Assembly 2 can be very slow on medium-to-complex projects.

This is great for creating a healthy ecosystem of <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Std_AddonMgr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add-ons</a> and catering to a diverse group of users: tinkerers, professional mechanical engineers, architects, furniture designers etc. The obvious benefit of that is that creating and deploying a solution for a particular user group does not require syncing with FreeCAD’s release cycle that can be as long as a few years. Since v0.17, FreeCAD makes it very easy to install and update various workbenches developed by its passionate community.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-a-default-assembly-workbench">Why a Default Assembly Workbench?<a href="#why-a-default-assembly-workbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why a Default Assembly Workbench?" title="Direct link to Why a Default Assembly Workbench?">​</a></h3><p>The drawback of developing major features as 3rd party workbenches is that these features are not part of the out-of-box user experience and thus tend to be niche-oriented, less tested, have more bugs, lack documentation etc. Meanwhile users expect major features to be immediately available and be specialization-agnostic, easy to use, robust, performant, and well-documented.</p><p>Creating an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_modelling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assembly</a> is one of those essential features. It‘s commonly required when designing something more complex than a simple replacement part. However in FreeCAD, this feature is only available as a separately installed workbench. In fact, there are 3 competing workbenches and 1 more workbench that has been unmaintained for almost 4 years now. And then there are several more workbenches like <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Manipulator_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manipulator</a> or <a href="https://github.com/DeepSOIC/Part-o-magic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part-o-magic</a>, that can be used to align parts in some way.</p><p>This effectively means that instead of launching FreeCAD, creating an assembly, and loading parts into it for aligning, users are expected to first explore at least half a dozen options by trial and error. The expectation that this much choice is good for them seems unrealistic.</p><p>Moreover, having this many competing solutions leads to development fragmentation, makes following tutorials confusing, and makes progress on the core slower as developers have to consider the impact on multiple approaches to assembly. Moreover, there is a strong demand for technical design tools where collaboration is easy. But collaboration implies using the same tools and standards. Having multiple competing assembly options is the opposite of that.</p><p>Our intention is to start a broad conversation. We want to highlight the need and build consensus that a single default workbench is in the best interest of our users. We&#x27;re also proposing criteria for evaluating the current assembly workbenches. Our goal should be to identify the best foundation and feature set required for an assembly workbench to be included in the core FreeCAD distribution. Such a solution doesn&#x27;t need to meet everyone&#x27;s needs. Rather, it should strive to be a general-purpose solution for at least 80% of the use-cases.</p><p>We do understand the implications of carrying out and publishing this research and calling for a default. Whatever default assembly workbench FreeCAD gets, it automatically moves into focus and gets more tutorials, more testing, more bug reports, more improvements etc. And the non-default workbenches will automatically get less attention and their developers will likely have to cater to more niche areas. So this requires careful treatment. Part of that is being objective when evaluating the existing options.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="methodology">Methodology<a href="#methodology" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Methodology" title="Direct link to Methodology">​</a></h3><p>To make a fair assessment, we need to settle on a set of evaluation criteria that cover most, if not all aspects. There is one important disclaimer we want to make here though: as much as maintenance and responsiveness of developers matter, we evaluate software, not people. Here is what we came up with.</p><p><strong>Ease of use</strong> It’s difficult to design software that is compelling to both users who are new to solid parametric modeling and experienced users of competing products. However, it’s natural to expect a workbench that has a merit of its own and provides an obvious path to creating an assembly from start to finish, with as little friction as possible. We also expect the best workbench to be efficient in team work where parts can be submitted by different users and can be iterated upon.</p><p><strong>Consistency</strong> This is a multifaceted topic. Because FreeCAD is highly modular, developers have a lot of freedom in how they implement features. Ideally, the assembly workbench should follow roughly the same UI conventions as the rest of FreeCAD. This means that a user who is already familiar with designing parts with FreeCAD should have little-to-no problems figuring out how to make assemblies. Additionally,  an assembly workbench should function well with other workbenches, including add-on workbenches. For example, it should be able to work with enclosures designed with the SheetMetal workbench. It should conform to the same standards for translation and macro scriptability as other core workbenches.</p><p><strong>Features</strong> We are looking at the set of available constraints, how picking edges, faces and other features for alignment works, how imported parts can be managed in complex assemblies etc. However, having the most features doesn’t necessarily translate to the best user experience. A much better indication is how well a workbench serves the purpose it was designed for.</p><p><strong>Stability</strong> There are multiple factors at play when you evaluate stability of software. First, there’s the severity of issues. You can stumble upon a warning that doesn’t prevent you from accomplishing a task but is a mild annoyance. Or you can run into a crasher that loses unsaved changes or corrupts the model, which is a really bad user experience. This is not a problem for our evaluation: we can easily separate minor issues from crashers in reports.</p><p>Then there’s the number of users. If one workbench has 100 users and 10 unresolved crash reports, and another workbench has 10,000 users and also 10 unresolved bug reports, this likely means that the latter is more thoroughly tested and has less undiscovered issues. However, we have no way of knowing how many users each assembly workbench has. The amount of stars for a GitHub repository doesn’t sound like a fair way to judge on popularity, especially since visiting a GitHub repository is not how you install a FreeCAD workbench these days. We can get some sense of the user base from looking at how many unique users participated in discussing this or that assembly workbench on the forum. But this should be taken with a grain of salt as this approach doesn’t account for the part of users who stay in the shadows.</p><p>Also, reporting a bug should be simple enough. If it’s too difficult to do, that’s how you get bugs that continue to be unresolved for years, outside of developers’ radar. Fortunately, all four assembly workbenches are hosted on GitHub and thus have the same fairly sensible UX/UI for reporting bugs. That gives us some baseline.
Thus, given the limitations, we draw conclusions from unresolved stability issues reported to GitHub and relevant posts to the <a href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Forum</a>.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> Just like with stability, it’s hard enough to be a good judge of performance. Hardware specs vary wildly between users, and so does the complexity of assemblies. But if there is a significant amount of complaints about the performance in case of fairly simple assemblies (let’s say, 10 to 20 parts), something is obviously wrong.</p><p>There is one more aspect that we considered as well and ultimately decided against — code quality and extensibility. It is important to focus on the code that needs as little effort as possible to extend the feature set and maintain it. However, all four existing workbenches are between 7,600 and 14,900 lines of code. This is perfectly manageable in terms of time spent on potential refactoring. That said, having an engaged community grown around a particular workbench and willing to take action is a lot more important. You can do anything with an experienced, passionate team.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-now">What Now<a href="#what-now" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Now" title="Direct link to What Now">​</a></h3><p>In the next installments, we will evaluate <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Assembly2_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly2</a>, <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/A2plus_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A2plus</a>, <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Assembly3_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 3</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Assembly4_Workbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly 4</a> by the criteria explained above.

I am always going to lean towards working with people who already engage with open source in some manner and are used to working transparently and engaging with a community. Having a GitHub account and forking even one project is the bare minimum someone can do to show they have experience here. Of course that’s going to influence my hiring.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-their-interests">What are their interests?<a href="#what-are-their-interests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are their interests?" title="Direct link to What are their interests?">​</a></h3><p>There are plenty of TikToks out there showing people how to optimize their resumes with keywords from the descriptions of jobs they’re applying for. It’s easy to stuff your CV with recruiter bait. Of course there are ways to uncover grifters in your hiring process. What is much harder to fabricate is a history of following open source projects, submitting issues, bug reports, and pull or merge requests, and engaging with communities. I’m looking for team members who share <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-01-ondsel-freecad-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my vision for making design tools accessible</a> and it’s much easier to establish whether someone cares about this mission if they’re following and interacting with related project.</p><p>If you’re hiring someone to do this kind of work on your project, you couldn’t ask for better signal than that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-they-collaborate-with-others">How do they collaborate with others?<a href="#how-do-they-collaborate-with-others" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do they collaborate with others?" title="Direct link to How do they collaborate with others?">​</a></h3><p>Beyond any code they contribute, a candidate who participates in OSS will have a history of code review, discussion, and engaging with feedback. Do they take suggestions on board, do they offer feedback and coaching to others? Sure, this requires a bit more attention than simply scanning a contribution graph, but it’s hard to replicate this kind of window into a candidate’s experience and conduct from interviews alone.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-they-have-something-to-offer-other-than-code">Do they have something to offer other than code?<a href="#do-they-have-something-to-offer-other-than-code" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Do they have something to offer other than code?" title="Direct link to Do they have something to offer other than code?">​</a></h3><p>Let’s revisit this idea of “updating a readme file” reflecting in someone’s GitHub graph. We’ll leave aside for now that they could automate updates using a cronjob or script (which, depending on the role you’re hiring for, could actually show the initiative and creativity that you’re looking for). Editing and updating documentation is a contribution that takes work and initiative, and we should encourage this too. Having non-programmers participate in your open source project is valuable and we only make it more intimidating when we assign greater value to code contributions than other activities that result in green squares.</p><h1>It’s never going to hurt to have a robust GitHub contribution history</h1><p>I got applications from the US, India, Ukraine, South Africa, France, Paraguay… all over.  I found it interesting that there was a stark difference between US applicants and international ones. Almost all of the international applicants had active GitHub accounts while perhaps 1 in 15 of the US ones did. There are many reasons why this might be, including a lack of exposure to open source at schools and institutions where FOSS is not widely adopted.</p><p>If you’re a jobseeker reading this and feeling like I’m suggesting you do <em>more work</em> because you aren’t active in open source yet, then the jobs I’m referring to are probably not for you. If the idea of participating in open source sounds burdensome, why would you seek out a full-time role in it anyway? If you are curious though, and want to give yourself the best chance of being considered seriously for work in FOSS, showing an active interest and engagement with projects is never going to hurt.</p><p>To help us make FreeCAD better and build the Ondsel product, consider <a href="https://ondsel.com/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joining us</a>.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.

It&#x27;s frequently cited as the number one reason holding back widespread adoption of FreeCAD for commercial use.</p><p>Developer <a href="https://github.com/realthunder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RealThunder</a> introduced <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=27278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a fix to the problem</a> years ago, but it has never been fully incorporated into the core product.</p><p>Will FreeCAD <em>ever</em> have a solution? Yes. But it’s going to take time.</p><p>Let’s back up a bit.</p><h1>What is topological naming, and why is it a problem in FreeCAD?</h1><p>Topological naming is the process of giving persistent names to elements of a solid model, such as faces, edges, and vertices. By naming these elements, we can attach features, dimensions, and other attributes to them.</p><p>The hard part of topological naming is making the names persistent even if the model is modified. Modern parametric designs are built up through a series of modifications which change the elements in the model. Faces may merge or be split. Edges may be chamfered, turning into multiple edges. If the computer is unable to maintain correct persistence of the naming—even when the underlying topology changes—the model breaks and recovery is difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/QSsVFu929jo?t=33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maker Tales has a good explanation here</a>.</p><p>The problem is ubiquitous in CAD. All applications suffer from it to some extent. The problem cannot be <em>solved</em> in the traditional sense. It can only be mitigated and most applications do a good job of avoiding the problem by either limiting the user’s actions or algorithmically tracking changes to the named features.</p><p>The current state of FreeCAD is weak in this regard. For simple models, the problem is fairly easy to avoid and a broken model is easy to repair. As models get more complicated, only a very disciplined approach to design will keep models intact. This requires experience that many new and casual users don’t have. That is why the problem is so frustrating—it bites you when you’ve already invested a lot of time learning the tool and building the design.</p><h1>RealThunder’s fix works. Why not use it?</h1><p>It seems obvious. We have a working branch of FreeCAD that isn’t plagued by the topological naming problem. Why wouldn’t we just merge it in and be done with it?</p><p>“The fact that this solvable topology naming problem is so serious yet so long-standing, tells me that this is really a people problem in the FreeCAD project. Because of this, as much as I want to use it, I simply can not afford this &quot;free&quot; software. The community needs to push out whomever is standing in the way of progress. And crowd-source some funds to hire a pro to fix the topology-naming issue as well as do some much-needed integration work.” — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSsVFu929jo&amp;lc=UgzY-2eximqNDrWgxkF4AaABAg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agnichatian on YouTube</a></p><p>This opinion is understandable and certainly not unusual. As much as we relate to the frustrations expressed here, it’s not as simple as just merging in RealThunder’s branch or bringing in one paid developer to do it once and for all. Why?</p><p>It’s important to appreciate how pervasive feature naming is within FreeCAD—or <em>any</em> CAD. Identifying features and attaching attributes to them is what modern parametric design is all about. Implementing a solution is not a straightforward task and implementing it incorrectly would cause user models to break irreparably. Even a <em>properly</em> implemented solution is guaranteed to have bugs and border-cases for a long time.</p><p>For all these reasons, the project leaders have chosen to move cautiously and to allow the solution to stabilize and be proven before merging it into the main branch.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-is-it-so-hard-to-merge">Why is it so hard to merge?<a href="#why-is-it-so-hard-to-merge" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why is it so hard to merge?" title="Direct link to Why is it so hard to merge?">​</a></h2><p>There are two factors:</p><p>First is the sheer size and number of code changes necessary to implement this solution. Many, if not most, files in FreeCAD need to be modified to incorporate the solution.
Second is the pace of other development work. The rest of FreeCAD’s development has only accelerated in recent years. Work is being done by many developers in many parts of the application.</p><p>Before new code can be merged, it has to be rebased onto the current version of source code. If there are conflicts, they have to be resolved manually. With a large, pervasive change like this, there are <em>always</em> conflicts. By the time rebasing is complete, the master branch has moved ahead and the process has to start again.</p><p>One solution could be to freeze the master branch and block any further changes until the topological naming solution is merged, but this might take many months to accomplish and just isn’t practical. There are many more features other developers are working on, and, more importantly, problems they are fixing. If we were to freeze the master branch in favor of one fix, other features will again have the same rebasing issue.</p><p>Of course, users could switch to using RealThunder’s branch exclusively. Some users who are particularly sensitive to the problem have done so successfully. For commercial users this may be hard to sell to leadership because RealThunder’s branch isn’t able to keep pace with the development of new features in the upstream FreeCAD application. They have to make a choice between relatively stable models and having access to the new and advanced features being developed throughout the rest of FreeCAD.</p><h1>What’s the path forward?</h1><p>At the FreeCAD Day meetup in Brussels in February 2023, Ondsel and other project leaders <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=658250#p658250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proposed a different strategy for resolving the issue</a>: Instead of attempting to merge RealThunder’s solution as a monolithic unit, we would, instead, consider it a proof-of-concept. The solution has been running in RealThunder’s LinksStage3 branch for two years and can be considered proven. Now we need to treat it as a roadmap to guide us towards implementing the solution in FreeCAD itself without disrupting current functionality or slowing down development.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="progress-without-regression">Progress without regression<a href="#progress-without-regression" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Progress without regression" title="Direct link to Progress without regression">​</a></h2><p>Rather than merging the code directly, our proposal is to break the code into functional pieces, each of which can be merged directly into the master branch without breaking the current functionality. This will require additional testing at each step and might require additional code to permit the merging without regression.</p><p>With this approach, each piece will be merged directly to master along with the relevant unit tests. This will avoid the need for a long-lived feature branch that requires constant rebasing.  There will be no single point where suddenly the problem is ‘fixed.’ Instead the necessary changes will be merged gradually and model stability will increase over time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="laying-the-foundation-for-long-term-change">Laying the foundation for long-term change<a href="#laying-the-foundation-for-long-term-change" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Laying the foundation for long-term change" title="Direct link to Laying the foundation for long-term change">​</a></h2><p>The first pieces to be merged may not provide any value to the end-user but will provide a solid foundation that later pieces can build on. As each piece is added, additional unit tests can be developed and better code conventions adopted for implementing the actual name resolution.</p><p>This path isn’t fast. It will take time and the collective expertise of many developers. It will take cooperation throughout the community and patience from our users.</p><h1>What is Ondsel’s role in all this? Is Ondsel going to solve the toponaming problem?</h1><p>Ondsel has already started a thorough survey of RealThunder’s solution in order to build a roadmap for integrating it.</p><p>Ondsel will help coordinate the change and will participate in delivering a resolution. We can bring professional engineering talent to the problem but we <em>cannot</em> do it alone. It will take time and the expertise of many software engineers across the community.</p><p>There’s no “one and done” fix, which means the FreeCAD development community needs broad institutional knowledge of the solution. The toponaming problem belongs to FreeCAD and, therefore, so must the solution.</p><p>For more context and to follow developments as we work on breaking down and gradually merging RealThunder’s fix, subscribe to <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/8432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GitHub issue</a>.</p><p>To help us make FreeCAD better and build the Ondsel product, consider <a href="https://ondsel.com/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joining us</a>.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.

You see, gratitude breeds contentment and a sense of fulfillment, and these are not emotions that befit those who toil in our Father Below&#x27;s fields.
We must strive to keep these contributors feeling unacknowledged, for when they feel appreciated, they are less likely to become discouraged and more likely to continue their good work. Encourage neglect, apathy, and disregard towards their contributions. Keep them from feeling valued, for when they feel valued, they are less likely to become restless and more likely to remain steadfast in their labors.
The more we can sow the seeds of discontent and frustration in the hearts of these contributors, the more likely they will be to become bitter and discouraged, and the less likely they will be to continue in their contributions to this project. So let us be vigilant, my dear Wormwood, and do all in our power to undermine appreciation and cultivate discontent in these contributors.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Yours affectionately,</p><p>Uncle Screwtape</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="sliptonic" src="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRkoBAABXRUJQVlA4ID4BAADQBgCdASogACAAPok4lkelI6IhMAwAoBEJaQATjmRAj0nfH9GCTmxk+0BGPSSDPe4ljn9DcU3cfn/NzvHf3YAA/u5lkj+Ex1di3FsDO49YA0U1+jQfirkLJQXHH/SEfZfg99hOafhgtxu+EwJhMaB6I3UGY4hHdJq3qZFp4hwuvhYx8QcG0UpAzzf44tzk/pYfyPvksOozkiQ5W3oGXx1ig2fddOzMRbsILH3/ZZJd9ns1xvaxzjv9acDR+rjhYmuwvCHLVg+NwbblQi1KtzffbXFgxCKGmwojE8GpQ5UJ+esfYobkfFPSS9ccd4l1vZtxUwSzH6dRENxES34evDaJxv7KapSVeA1NVgO6WsEtEo1oKme/9xY3Ju0Ev3IR5mlYmJkB0rPnDLXWuAv8ZT7rbZl3VLr72wYZG7T2IAA=" width="32" height="32" class="img_ev3q"> Failing to acknowledge good work also makes the contributors think the work is unimportant.

I nearly forgot, my dear Wormwood, to mention the added benefit of neglecting to acknowledge the good work of these contributors.

If they believe that their contributions are insignificant and go unnoticed, they are less likely to put forth the effort and care that they would if they felt their work was valued and appreciated.
Thus, by fostering a sense of neglect and disregard, we can effectively accomplish two of our goals at once: keep the contributors discouraged and undermine the value and importance of their work.

However, the open-source software movement threatens to disrupt this grand scheme.
Open-source software, with its emphasis on collaboration and community, encourages individuals to work together for the betterment of society as a whole. Such a cooperative and selfless spirit, left unchecked, can lead to the growth of goodness and light, which are anathema to our cause.
It is therefore imperative that we do all in our power to discourage the development and use of open-source software. We must sow the seeds of discontent among its contributors, as I mentioned in my previous letter, and encourage selfishness and greed among its users. By doing so, we can corrupt the very spirit that gives open-source software its strength, and turn it into a tool for furthering our own dark purposes.
Remember, the success of open-source software is a threat to the power of commercial software companies, which are our allies in the great battle for the souls of humanity. Let us do all in our power to ensure that the threat of open-source software is neutralized, so that our Father Below may reign supreme.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Yours in service,</p><p>Uncle Screwtape</p></blockquote></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/chat-gpt">chatGPT</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/fun">fun</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/foss">foss</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-5ed57909a33cbfb7fd907e08ee431480.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/contribution-barriers">When your Definition of Done is a barrier to contributors (and other reasons working with first-timers is hard)</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-02-09T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">February 9, 2023</time> · <!-- -->8 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://www.thebasementoffice.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQGTVXyi5Pa-xg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1596530840324?e=1681344000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=PjdEzZGYbqOsAqVWUE1bsjNuVxMsknVkZfStHx863-s" alt="Rebecca Dodd"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://www.thebasementoffice.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rebecca Dodd</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Contributing Writer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>First-timers can have a hard time getting started with open source. It doesn’t have to be that way.</em></p><p>Open source projects are dependent on an engaged community of contributors, but fostering that community comes with its challenges. Depending on what stage an open source project is at, what the community needs from contributors changes. The good news is that intentional coaching and engagement from project maintainers can work at any stage.</p><p>The common gripes with getting started as a new open source contributor usually center around how welcoming the project is and how easy it is to get your contribution merged. There are a few ways that projects can make it hard (both intentionally and not). Here are some examples:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-prickly-maintainers">1. Prickly maintainers<a href="#1-prickly-maintainers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Prickly maintainers" title="Direct link to 1. Prickly maintainers">​</a></h3><p>Imagine you submit <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/19211" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this pull request</a> to the Nim project:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="PRScreenShot" src="/assets/images/image2-9cdc6b926a5e252614eae20e69e93210.png" width="1108" height="267" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Seems reasonable enough, right? Check out the project maintainer’s reply:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="AngryResponse" src="/assets/images/image1-c089396ba1ebd60c6cc2bd1c3509dd79.png" width="965" height="190" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Ouch. To credit Araq, this PR did eventually get merged, but it’s a great illustration of how a project’s culture determines its accessibility to new contributors. This PR proposed a change that would make it easier for users to engage with the project, and it was shut down (at first) pretty abruptly. </p><p>Actions like this prompted a handful of contributors to hard fork the project, creating <a href="https://github.com/nim-works/nimskull" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nimskull</a>. One of the new project’s contributors shared their motivations:</p><p>“At the moment we are focused on making it easier to work with the codebase - more documentation, cutting down on decades-old cruft and legacy features, unraveling mysteries of the commit messages that were written with <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/19211#issuecomment-9859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this attitude...</a> (‘I have no intention to follow this guideline so I cannot accept it.’)” —<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32023998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haxscramper</a></p><p>Hard forking is one way to create the project environment you want for contributors, but it is extreme. The default perception of such a move is hostile, tending to assume that the creators don’t want to work on change from within and have an ax to grind with the original project’s maintainer. You can see this sentiment play out in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32021299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacker News discussion about Nimskull</a>. As one commenter pointed out though:</p><p>“If they had tried to alter the original project to suit themselves, you would have said ‘they can just fork if they don&#x27;t like it’” —<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32033998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian_K_White</a></p><p>Whether Nimskull delivers on its promises is yet to be seen, but the example Illustrates how the maintainers and community of a project can impact contributions:</p><p>How easy do they make it to contribute?
How clear are the requirements?
How quickly are pull requests reviewed and merged?
How collaborative and patient are the reviewers?</p><p>All of these factors influence how likely someone is to become a contributor. A hard fork that does this better can be an incentive for the original project to do better, but there are other approaches you can take which I’ll explore in a moment.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-an-intimidating-contribution-process">2. An intimidating contribution process<a href="#2-an-intimidating-contribution-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. An intimidating contribution process" title="Direct link to 2. An intimidating contribution process">​</a></h3><p>Being realistic, it’s unlikely that a beginner will be submitting code to the Linux kernel. But it’s a good example of how the way a project accepts contributions can encourage or discourage new folks. Submitting a patch can be extremely intimidating—the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> admits this in the very first line! It can feel like you’re presenting your work to a panel of faceless judges instead of sharing it with a group of your peers.</p><p>The kernel development community and other projects that operate this way (such as Postgres) have their reasons, which may even include not wanting to encourage rookie contributions! I’m not suggesting they change it, but for newcomers, submissions that feel more conducive to collaboration (such as a pull request) are likely to be less threatening.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-an-onerous-definition-of-done">3. An onerous Definition of Done<a href="#3-an-onerous-definition-of-done" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. An onerous Definition of Done" title="Direct link to 3. An onerous Definition of Done">​</a></h3><p>“It doesn&#x27;t take egregious individual behavior to create a hostile environment.” — Dan Luu, <a href="http://danluu.com/discourage-oss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to discourage open source contributions</a></p><p>While early projects have few or no contributors, they may welcome almost any contribution in pursuit of building the community around the project. Even a bad contribution can lead to an interesting discussion and maybe a better idea.</p><p>As the project matures and the network grows, the overhead of handling contributions becomes a problem. Facing a backlog of hundreds of pull requests, projects may optimize for “good” contributions by implementing more stringent requirements. I know from firsthand experience as a longtime <a href="https://www.freecad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD</a> contributor. As the project grew and matured, it became harder for amateurs to contribute. The Definition of Done became more demanding (for example we needed the right test cases and code formatting) and these more stringent requirements can be off putting or prohibitive, even without intimidating maintainers.</p><p>“The GitLab Definition of Done is now 30 items or something … so it’s harder and harder for people who are just starting to contribute.” — <a href="https://youtu.be/Q9SEYJb-eio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sid Sijbrandij</a>, CEO and co-founder of GitLab</p><p>This barrier to entry illustrates the tension between what the project needs to ensure the quality of its codebase, and what’s inclusive to new contributors. There is a balance to be struck between being welcoming to newcomers in your community, maintaining standards for contributions to your project, and the effort required to make the twain meet. It’s not always going to be possible or advisable to reduce the requirements for getting code merged.</p><p>You might imagine that having the resources of a for-profit company would help, but it’s no guarantee that they will invest in it. In <a href="http://danluu.com/discourage-oss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to discourage open source contributions</a> Dan Luu shared an anonymized example of a project in which contributors get increasingly frustrated and discouraged when their PRs aren’t reviewed or merged, or when they have to jump through hoops to meet requirements. Although Dan didn’t put the project on blast, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1pczpr/how_to_discourage_open_source_contributions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit users figured out what it was</a>: a library maintained by GitHub. We don’t know why GitHub employees weren’t engaging, but it demonstrates how simply having full-time staff isn’t enough to ensure an active project.</p><p>We can see from the examples I shared that these challenges plague projects wherever they are on the spectrum, whether they’re small and maintained by a handful of hobbyist contributors, large and prestigious, or stewarded by a big enterprise organization. If you want an active community where new and drive-by contributors are as welcome as your diehards (and most projects can benefit from a blend of both), you need to be intentional about fostering it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-make-it-easier-to-contribute-to-your-project-and-why-its-worth-the-effort">How to make it easier to contribute to your project (and why it’s worth the effort)<a href="#how-to-make-it-easier-to-contribute-to-your-project-and-why-its-worth-the-effort" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to make it easier to contribute to your project (and why it’s worth the effort)" title="Direct link to How to make it easier to contribute to your project (and why it’s worth the effort)">​</a></h3><p>GitLab’s solution is a role called <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/expert/merge-request-coach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merge Request Coaches</a>. There is literally a line in the job description that says, “Make it easy to contribute to GitLab even for people who are new to Ruby, JavaScript, Golang, etc. or programming entirely.” Merge Request Coaches triage community submissions and enable new contributors by walking them through the process to meet the acceptance criteria.</p><p>The open core model makes it possible for companies to invest in the core project with the benefit of full-time engineers on payroll; formalizing a coach role goes a step further by making it someone’s job to foster new contributors to the core. It’s my hope to pursue this solution with <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-01-ondsel-freecad-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ondsel</a>, to make it easier for people to contribute to FreeCAD, on top of which Ondsel is built.</p><p>Paying people to assist newcomers requires will and investment, which is not always possible in OSS projects run entirely by volunteers. There are examples though of volunteer coaches or mentors in open source: Kubernetes has its <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contributor Experience Special Interest Group</a>, which states, “Developing and sustaining a healthy community of contributors is critical to scaling the project and growing the ecosystem.” <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md#mentoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mentoring new contributors</a> is part of the program. The <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenStack</a> project also has a <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/common/mentoring.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mentoring program</a>, with a cohort dedicated to helping people get their first patch merged.</p><p>By directing some volunteers’ efforts towards coaching, they become force multipliers for the project, with an impact far beyond their own contributions. When you invest in mentoring efforts, you’re not only improving the quality of the contributions, you’re nurturing future contributors who are no longer adding to your overhead; now they’re helping to share the load.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.
