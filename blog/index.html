FreeCAD is no exception. Some of the most common complaints raised by users are about the steep learning curve, inconsistent workflow, and ugly, confusing user-interface (UI). There are dozens of threads on the forum going back years where someone has come forward with a vision to ‘fix’ the usability problem. These efforts always devolve into bike-shedding, and nitpicking. Nothing changes.</p><p>Why does this keep happening?  After all, UI/UX is an established discipline. There are books and published research about it.  There are <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consultants</a> and ‘best practices’.  Why is it so hard to make progress?</p><p>The answer is that like other parts of the umbrella discipline called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘human factors’</a>, UI/UX is all about humans and humans are messy.   Unlike source code that either works or doesn’t, there are many ways to skin the usability cat.  Most of us use software all the time with no appreciation or understanding of why it’s good or bad. We know good design when we see it but most of us can’t say why it’s good.  When we use software that we like, we attribute our positive perception to whichever UI elements we notice.  We overlook the thousands of other elements that don’t catch our attention because they just work right.</p><p><em>Mary likes the way DoodlyCAD uses ribbon bars.  FreeCAD doesn’t have ribbon bars and that’s why she hates FreeCAD.  She didn’t notice that DoodlyCAD has consistent task panels, great use of screen real estate, and excellent discoverability of features.</em></p><p>“Ok, smart guy”, I hear you say.  “Is the situation hopeless?  Can we possibly make progress in this area?”.  Yes, dear reader, I think we can.  In fact, I think we are!  A small but industrious team led by Obelisk on the FreeCAD Discord server has started an initiative that aims to avoid the pitfalls of the past and move us in a direction that is data- and research-driven, productive, and sustainable. </p><p>The approach they are taking starts with first principles of UI/UX design.  If you spend time reading the channel, you’ll hear terms like <a href="https://lawsofux.com/fittss-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fitts law</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/weavedesign/the-doherty-threshold-and-designing-for-human-computer-interaction-f0a47c8ab583" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doherty threshold</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hick-Hyman</a>, and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Usability-Heuristics</a>. Rather than focusing on individual features, they are establishing an overarching conception of how the user experience should be organized.  This isn’t a bold new vision with grand unattainable goals.  It first seeks to understand and document how the FreeCAD experience works when it works well. That documentation is the <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/stylebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Guide</a>.</p><p>As the design guide matures, we can use the guidelines to review the user experience when it doesn’t work well and improve it without introducing new inconsistencies.</p><p>The project has larger goals.  They’re spending considerable time talking about zones of the UI, task flow, and what the default configuration should be.  They’re also thinking about how UI templates can be created that make it easier for developers to implement new functionality without needing to reinvent the wheel every time.   Effort has been spent on recommendations for color use, code structure, and other details that will help addon developers make their contributions feel like a native part of FreeCAD.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;After more than 20 years of development by a global community of volunteers, an incredibly complex and advanced set of features is available in FreeCAD. My hope is to leverage all of the incredible time and effort invested by that community to present a coherent vision for both beginner and advanced users that is based on strong principles. With the highly anticipated 1.0 release on the horizon an opportunity to help provide a positive &#x27;out-of-the-box&#x27; experience and improve general productivity is extremely exciting.&quot; -Joe Sardos (Obelisk)</p></blockquote><p>Yet, it’s the short-term objectives that are likely to make the biggest difference soon.  Identifying the easy fixes where user pain can be alleviated fast doesn’t just fix the problems, it gives new developers an easy on-ramp to start contributing code that will get merged.  Documenting the glossary helps with documentation, translation, and the design of future features. Clear guidelines on UI elements makes it easier to develop features and it also speeds up the review and approval process which takes load off of the maintainers.  It also makes documentation easier to write and faster to translate.</p><p>If our enthusiasm for this project isn’t clear, let me give you a few more reasons why we’re so excited this is happening and so honored to participate.   First, the data-driven and research based approach helps eliminate the toxic in-fighting on the forum.  That’s something we can all get behind.  The effort is community-led but not developer driven.  In our opinion, it’s wonderful to see other kinds of experts getting involved in open-source work.  We would love to see FOSS being a place for UI/UX experts to build experience and ultimately a career.  And finally, it provides another opportunity for the FPA to financially advance the project. The FPA is now <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fpadf-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offering grants</a> to train UI/UX contributors who commit to work on this for an extended period.  </p><p>[include a quote by someone in FPA]</p><p>Unlike other development efforts like the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-needs-a-better-materials-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Material system overhaul</a> or the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly Workbench</a>,  improving the UI is a long-term commitment.  It’s many, <em>many</em> small improvements over time and not a single major push from a few people.  It will take time but it will work.  We’re on our way to a great user experience.  Forward!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ux">ux</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ui">ui</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-d7c0a82cc10e737c4570c34d3f8c4475.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/assembly-workbench-preview">Ondsel added integrated assembly to the FreeCAD core finally solving the largest missing feature</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-11-06T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 6, 2023</time> · <!-- -->9 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/prokoudine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57467?v=4" alt="Alexandre Prokoudine"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/prokoudine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Alexandre Prokoudine</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Contributing Writer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The basics of an integrated assembly workbench in FreeCAD are now functional and will be ready for for wider testing once <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another pull request</a> is merged. This means you can play with it now in the development version of FreeCAD and when version 1.0 is out, you will be able to create or link parts, create joints between them, and solve the assembly — in just a few clicks, out of the box, without installing any add-ons.</p><p>This quick video by Pierre-Louis Boyer demonstrates all that:</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:1rem"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mFsieFzOPls" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0"></iframe></div><p>This is by no means the complete implementation that we have in mind for FreeCAD, but it’s a solid foundation. And because we like to be open about our process, let’s talk about how we got to this point, how we made design decisions, what’s already available, and what else is in the pipeline.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-research">The research<a href="#the-research" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The research" title="Direct link to The research">​</a></h2><p>Users have been asking for an integrated assembly workbench for a very long time. And because writing add-ons has always been the preferable way to implement major new features in FreeCAD, people did just that: multiple 3rd-party options, each with its own workflow, incompatible with one another.</p><p>Doing extensive research of multiple assembly workbenches is really a lot to ask. And thus, users got more than what they bargained for: a solution wrapped up in confusion. Whenever a new user arrived and asked for recommendations, a very common response would be along the lines of “I don’t really know about those other workbenches, I only bothered to learn this one”.</p><p>This gave us three basic options:</p><ol><li>Pick one existing workbench, improve it, make it the default</li><li>Create a new workbench based on one or more of the existing alternatives</li><li>Create a new workbench entirely from scratch</li></ol><p>We started with a deep dive into four popular workbenches — Assembly 2, A2plus, Assembly3, and Assembly4 — and then looked at a few assembly-like add-ons. If you missed that series, <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/default-assembly-workbench-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this final post</a> has all the links and discusses our plan forward at the time.</p><p>The most important takeaway from the research was that every available option had some kind of workflow and/or UX/UI problem deeply rooted into its design. So we came up with the following recommendations:</p><ol><li>Agree on the data structure with stakeholders to help making all assembly workbenches mutually compatible</li><li>Create or reuse an existing performant 3D solver</li><li>Build a clean new solution that could be iterated upon later to add advanced features</li><li>Ship a working basic implementation as part of the next big release after v0.21</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="assembly-data-structure">Assembly data structure<a href="#assembly-data-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Assembly data structure" title="Direct link to Assembly data structure">​</a></h2><p>After the research, we proceeded with standardization of the data structure. So far, only Zolko (Assembly4) has been up to discussing this. Both A2plus and Assembly3 developers haven’t yet responded to an invitation to talk about it. With luck we’ll get all major stakeholders to agree on something and/or provide conversion scripts for existing assembly projects.</p><p>We ended up designing the assembly as a Part container, just like in Assembly 4. However, multiple assemblies can be created in one document. We are not married to this design decision though and will happily reconsider if users speak up.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Assembly project structure" src="/assets/images/assembly-project-structure-70e5f23666038a702e1a778db385c1b2.webp" width="1795" height="841" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workflow-considerations">Workflow considerations<a href="#workflow-considerations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Workflow considerations" title="Direct link to Workflow considerations">​</a></h2><p>Before designing the new workbench, we looked at existing implementations in various proprietary CAD programs. We were mostly interested in how the workflow is organized and what program demands the least amount of clicks and learning from users.</p><p>There are two major approaches to constraining parts in 3D: either you select geometric features and mate them directly, or you create a local coordinate system (LCS) per each feature involved and then align those LCSs. Our implementation is a bit of both: the user does choose a pair of geometric features to connect, but FreeCAD also creates (and displays) a local joint coordinate system (JCS) for each feature.</p><p>We also found that, regardless of the workflow approach, developers of other programs indeed try to reduce the amount of clicks to an absolute minimum and make it easy to move parts under constraints.</p><p>Since we decided in favor of LCS (kinda), we’d be better off looking at something like T-FLEX CAD rather than Assembly4 for workflow tips. And in most proprietary CAD programs, moving a part means you just grab it and then drag it, whereas in Assembly3 you have three movement options in the toolbar (and it’s the least of your problems there).</p><p>The most approachable assembly workflow that we discovered was the Onshape’s one, hence much of our interaction design is loosely based on it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-what-can-the-integrated-assembly-workbench-do">So what can the integrated assembly workbench do?<a href="#so-what-can-the-integrated-assembly-workbench-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So what can the integrated assembly workbench do?" title="Direct link to So what can the integrated assembly workbench do?">​</a></h2><p>Our intention with this project is to create a solution that Just Works™ nine times out of ten. For the things it can’t do, the addon workbenches are still available and still good choices. The current state of the integrated workbench is a lean, minimally functional solution. It is, however, a solid foundation for building future functionality.</p><p>First off, it will support both top-down and bottom-up design approaches. Right now, you can create the assembly project, then proceed linking parts from existing FreeCAD projects. Or you can switch to Part Design and start building your parts, then go back to Assembly to constrain those parts.</p><p>Once you have all the parts you need in the project, choose a joint type in the toolbar.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Joints toolbar" src="/assets/images/assembly-joints-toolbar-752ccc03f94e23b76939d9a729ec8862.webp" width="1263" height="485" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So far, available joint types are:</p><ul><li>Fixed joint: zero degrees of freedom, parts are permanently locked together</li><li>Revolute joint: allow rotation around a single axis between selected parts</li><li>Cylindrical joint: allow rotation along one axis and movement along the same axis between two parts</li><li>Slider joint: allow movement along one axis between two parts</li><li>Ball joint: allow unrestricted movement of two parts as long as their connection points remain in contact</li><li>Planar joint: two selected features must be in the same plane, movement is restricted to that plane</li><li>Parallel joint: constrain relative movement of selected features to parallel translations</li><li>Tangent joint: forces two geometric features to be tangent, restrict movement to smooth transitions along their contact surface.</li></ul><p>When you select a joint type and hover a geometric feature of a part, FreeCAD displays a joint coordinate system for that feature:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Assembly JCS preview" src="/assets/images/assembly-jcs-preview-5b3335cd84c0a4c24a2a887a2a35f054.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So all you need to do is click on the hovered feature to add it to the selection (displayed in a floating dialog on the right), then pick a geometric feature of the second part and click OK.</p><p>Once all parts are connected with joints, you can move them under constraints. You don’t need an extra tool for that. Just grab a part and drag it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-organization">Project organization<a href="#project-organization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project organization" title="Direct link to Project organization">​</a></h2><p>We were really pleased with the way the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TNP project</a> operated, so we decided to model the assembly workbench project after it: public project board on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">done</a>), a mix of Ondsel employees and FreeCAD contributors (done), and atomic pull requests into the main development branch (done).</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Kanban board for the assembly project on GitHub" src="/assets/images/assembly-github-board-8783d55360618acc197a018e1ba3641f.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Our lead developer for the assembly workbench project is Pierre-Louis Boyer (‘Paddle’ on the FreeCAD forum) who already has a lot of experience improving UX/UI in FreeCAD.</p><p>Something we were missing was expertise in 3D solvers. We hired Dr. Aik-Siong Koh who has decades of experience in programming kinematic and multi-body dynamics solvers. He also has an existing solver originally written in Smalltalk. Dr. Koh ported his solver to C++ and made it <a href="https://github.com/Ondsel-Development/OndselSolver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available</a> under the terms of LGPL 2.1+.</p><p>Another Ondsel employee (and co-founder) John Dupuy contributed to turning Ondsel Solver into a shared library and fixing build issues on supported platforms.</p><p>Outside of Ondsel, FreeCAD maintainers Werner Mayer and Chris Hennes have been doing code review of all the pull requests we submitted.</p><p>We were also fortunate to receive contributions from the design review team early on: Qewer <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/10662#issuecomment-1716991225" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributed icons</a> for joints and <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improved</a> the appearance of JCS previews. Additionally, Tobias Falk and howie-j have been participating in the UX/UI discussions and providing <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11158" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patches</a>.</p><p>Based on our experience with the TNP and the assembly projects so far we are confident suggesting that this collaboration model should be used more in FreeCAD. Hopefully, more companies will adopt it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next" title="Direct link to What’s next">​</a></h2><p>Our attention right now is focused on <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">completing</a> the use of Ondsel Solver and cleaning up the rest. If the intention to release FreeCAD 1.0 around FOSDEM 2024 is still strong among maintainers, that gives us close to three months of leeway.</p><p>Implementing major new features in the workbench in time for v1.0 seems unlikely to happen, although minor enhancements like easily inserting fasteners is a possibility. So we will mostly be finishing what we have already started to deliver a lean, minimalistic, well-tested integrated assembly workbench in the v1.0 release.</p><p>After that the floor will be open to all sorts of things: BOM generation, collision detection, assembly explosion, animation etc. We are particularly excited about the possibilities that the new materials system by Dave Carter will bring to us. If you ever needed to calculate the weight of an entire assembly or locate its center of mass, you definitely know why.</p><p>We invite everyone to help us test and improve the new workbench. There is a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public kanban board</a> on GitHub where assembly-specific tasks are managed. Right now, we need testers even more than we need programmers. So come talk to us. Report a bug or  pick a card you would like to work on and comment on the related issue to get things going.</p><p>And finally, we believe this workbench will become an important part of the FreeCAD design kit.  We are confident that many great things can be built on top of this foundation and we’re not wasting time. We have already started an internal project to expand the feature set beyond what you would expect from an assembly workbench with a kinematic solver. Stay tuned for updates!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/assembly">assembly</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-bdc0886692eb3660d7e2926c8d19eae5.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/floating-input-widgets">FreeCAD sketcher getting a major upgrade with floating input widgets</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-10-30T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">October 30, 2023</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/prokoudine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57467?v=4" alt="Alexandre Prokoudine"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/prokoudine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Alexandre Prokoudine</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Contributing Writer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>We’ve already introduced some improvements to sketching with constraints before, when Pierre-Louis Boyer implemented <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/ondsel-made-constraining-sketches-faster-and-easier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contextual constraints</a>. But there are more usability gaps there, and we are targeting them one by one. There’s another major change currently undergoing code review: on-viewport tool widgets to create fully constrained sketches and tool settings to set various properties and choose drafting behavior.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="drafting-fully-constrained-sketches">Drafting fully constrained sketches<a href="#drafting-fully-constrained-sketches" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Drafting fully constrained sketches" title="Direct link to Drafting fully constrained sketches">​</a></h2><p>Thanks to Ondsel’s developer Pierre-Louis Boyer and FreeCAD maintainer Abdullah Tahiriyo, the Sketcher workbench is now getting UX/UI improvements that aim to improve drafting fully constrained sketches. Pierre-Louis shot a quick video for internal use that we are sharing with you.</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:1rem"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z-rA2zX5mas" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0"></iframe></div><p>Here is a quick explainer of what’s coming in version 1.0 here.</p><p>The usual workflow for creating a sketch is drawing shapes, then constraining them. That takes quite a while, if you intend to fully constrain a shape. Let’s say we draw just a line. To fully constrain it, we then have to:</p><ul><li>Select its start and constrain its distance to X and Y coordinate origins (for XY plane)</li><li>Select the line and constrain its distance</li><li>Add another constrain to define its angle to X (for XY plane)</li></ul><p>Of course, there are several more ways to fully constrain a line, but the general idea is the same: draw a line in roughly the right spot, then “fix” it.</p><p>If we are drawing more complex shapes (e.g. polygons), getting them fully constrained takes even more time and effort, though contextual constraints help with that somewhat. Can we speed it up? Yes, that’s the point of this coming improvement.</p><p>Now when you select a shape-drawing tool and hover the viewport, FreeCAD will display numeric entry widgets right in the viewport. When you type in a new value and press the <strong>Tab</strong> key, FreeCAD applies a constraint, updates the shape in the viewport, and moves the focus to the next entry widget. This is how it works for a line:</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/sketcher-fully-constrained-line.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>Currently supported objects are points, lines, rectangles, circles, and polygons. It’s possible to add support for more object types.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tool-settings">Tool settings<a href="#tool-settings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tool settings" title="Direct link to Tool settings">​</a></h2><p>The second user-visible part of the patch is introducing tool settings in the Tasks panel. This helps build more expressive tools.</p><p><strong>Different ways to define a shape</strong> will now be easily accessible: e.g. a line can be defined by the position of two points or by a combination of the start point’s coordinates, the length of the line, and the angle.</p><p>Another possibility is <strong>different shape styles</strong>. A rectangle with rounded corners can now be an option of the regular rectangle tool. Similarly, rectangles can have a frame around them with user-defined thickness.</p><p>Finally, you can use it to <strong>set an inherent property of a shape</strong>, such as the amount of sides in a polygon.</p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls=""><source src="/video/sketcher-tool-options-short.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>The same can be applied to arcs and conics later on.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="further-work">Further work<a href="#further-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Further work" title="Direct link to Further work">​</a></h2><p>This is still an early implementation undergoing review, so there will be both minor tweaks and new features further down the road. Here are some of the ideas we have:</p><ul><li>Enabling expressions in the spinboxes</li><li>Adding Rotate, Scale, Translate tools with on-viewport widgets</li><li>Adding a Chamfer tool to Sketcher</li></ul><p>Another thing we are planning to do is make full constraining an optional feature for users who want to be able to decide how many degrees of freedom they need for each particular shape. This could be a global preference setting or a quick toggle in the toolbar when you need to mix both approaches in the same project.</p><p>We are looking forward to reading your feedback. Until the patch has been merged, the best place to provide it is the <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull request</a>.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/sketcher">sketcher</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-2bd2c1d2e73f46f62e267eb1d762ecb1.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/hard-lessons">Autodesk is teaching students hard life-lessons about vendor lock-in</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-10-20T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">October 20, 2023</time> · <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://www.thebasementoffice.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="/img/Rebecca-Dodd-profile.JPEG" alt="Rebecca Dodd"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://www.thebasementoffice.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rebecca Dodd</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Contributing Writer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It’s common for vendors to make free licenses available to educational institutions, and while this can be helpful for enabling students to learn the tools of the trade, it can also set them up to learn some hard lessons about vendor lock-in once they go out on their own.</p><p>To add context to this piece we’ve included insights from <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/lukas-du-plessis-21424240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Lukas du Plessis</a>, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Pretoria (specializing in Machine Design and Manufacturing). Dr du Plessis introduced FreeCAD to his second-year curriculum back in 2020.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-is-proprietary-cad-software-the-default-at-universities">Why is proprietary CAD software the default at universities?<a href="#why-is-proprietary-cad-software-the-default-at-universities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why is proprietary CAD software the default at universities?" title="Direct link to Why is proprietary CAD software the default at universities?">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>“Corporations offer ‘student’ and ‘community’ licenses because they hope that these will lead to users getting jobs where they will ask their employers to purchase these tools. They do not do this because they want to nurture the hobbyists or craftspeople.” – <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/09/16/autodesk-announces-major-changes-to-fusion0-personal-use-license-terms/#comment-6279614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrightBlueJim on Hackaday.com</a></p></blockquote><p>It’s not an act of charity or goodwill for vendors to make their software free to use for educational purposes: the entrenchment of tools like SOLIDWORKS and Fusion 360 at these institutions is a key part of their pipeline as students graduate, enter the workforce, and advocate to use familiar tools at work.</p><p>These tools then become entrenched in workplaces, making it difficult for graduates to onboard if they don’t know how to use the software already:</p><blockquote><p>“Not choosing Autodesk is a career ending mistake in many cases, too.” –  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24505752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emteycz on Hacker News</a></p></blockquote><p>This is fine for students joining a big firm with plenty of budget for their seat. But good luck to graduates who want to start their own businesses and suddenly can’t afford the license.</p><p>This pattern is hard to shift, as educators can (understandably) be resistant to the burden of learning and then teaching a new tool. It’s tricky to coordinate across a department and align on what software is being used and taught in different years and modules. Even where educators are willing to bring in free alternatives (like FreeCAD), their lack of polish can be off putting to students.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="your-students-deserve-better">Your students deserve better<a href="#your-students-deserve-better" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Your students deserve better" title="Direct link to Your students deserve better">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>“F360 is probably the easiest to learn, but...

Your responsibility is to set them up for success by teaching them design principles, not one specific tool. Including exposure to open source solutions in curricula gives students a number of benefits:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="flexibility">Flexibility<a href="#flexibility" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Flexibility" title="Direct link to Flexibility">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>“It’s like a teacher teaching students to write a letter. The emphasis should be on the communication and writing skills—not on the tool. The teacher can’t teach the students to use Microsoft Word in order for them to write the letter.” – Dr Lukas du Plessis, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Pretoria</p></blockquote><p>Of course, it is important to introduce students to industry-standard, commercial software so that  they’re prepared for the workforce, but it’s a disservice not to at least expose them to the alternatives. Students who go into industry will be working in environments with mixed software, and educators should anticipate and include interoperability in the curriculum. They should be skeptical of software provided by corporations that doesn’t support data portability.</p><p>Students should at least understand that the choice of which software they use has long-term implications:</p><ul><li>Will they be able to switch to something else later if it becomes too expensive or no longer serves their needs?</li><li>Will it work on their own computer when they don’t have access to their current setup?</li></ul><p>Open source software unlocks far greater flexibility and customization for different use cases: for example, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxHr9sYNRUo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guitar workbench</a> presented at the <a href="https://www.up.ac.za/mechanical-and-aeronautical-engineering/article/3136162/freecad-users-conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD User Conference</a> earlier this year. “There’s no commercial package that will develop such a workbench, it’s far too niche,” says Dr du Plessis.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="performance">Performance<a href="#performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Performance" title="Direct link to Performance">​</a></h3><p>This aspect of the open source vs proprietary conversation doesn’t always get a lot of airtime, but it’s especially pertinent for educational institutions: commercial CAD software is often extremely hard wearing and resource intensive, and requires bleeding-edge hardware to perform at its best. Educational institutions rarely have access to the kind of hardware needed to make the software run effectively.</p><p>FreeCAD however is better suited for this environment, according to Dr du Plessis: “I introduced FreeCAD at the University of Pretoria and it’s not very hardware intensive—we’ve had no issues in the computer labs.”</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="institutions-can-be-the-change">Institutions can be the change<a href="#institutions-can-be-the-change" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Institutions can be the change" title="Direct link to Institutions can be the change">​</a></h2><p>It’s encouraging to see some educators taking initiative to change the course. Dr du Plessis, as mentioned above, has been advocating for students to get exposure to and learn FreeCAD at the University of Pretoria.</p><p>The university historically has taught SOLIDWORKS to students from their first year. As he started learning FreeCAD himself, Dr du Plessis has been introducing FreeCAD to his second-year students since 2020. “It doesn’t make sense to have access to free software, but then only afterwards the students need to start paying for exorbitant licenses.”</p><p>In 2019, Dr du Plessis received funding from the UK’s <a href="https://africaprize.raeng.org.uk/about-the-prize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royal Academy of Engineering</a> to develop a separate workbench inside FreeCAD. One of the deliverables was to introduce FreeCAD in the university’s undergraduate program, which helped give credibility to the initiative.</p><p>“I make students very much aware of the fact that commercial packages come at a premium,” says Dr du Plessis. “I also push hard for them to understand that there is a free version. Yes, it’s not as refined, but it’s good enough for 95% of what they want to do.”</p><p>Dr du Plessis also has a vision for what he calls FreeCAD Free Labs to make FreeCAD more accessible to more makers.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-educators-and-students-can-do">What educators and students can do<a href="#what-educators-and-students-can-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What educators and students can do" title="Direct link to What educators and students can do">​</a></h2><p>Yes, there is a burden to learning new technology and then teaching it to your students, but there are a lot of free resources out there that you can point students to. You can lean on educational creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FreeCADAcademy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Academy on YouTube</a> and the <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD community</a> so you can focus on teaching design principles.</p><p>To any students reading this, it’s also up to you to take responsibility for your own education. Be wary of any educator that requires a particular tool rather than teaching you the principles of use that can be generalized. You don’t need permission to explore alternative tools.</p><p>The <a href="https://fpa.freecad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Project Association</a> is interested in broadening the use of FreeCAD in education. They’ve set up a brief survey to gather feedback and start building a network of interested people.

There’s well over 200 various addons for FreeCAD available just in the official add-on manager. Many more possibly flew under the radar or simply never have been shared with anybody.</p><p>For some developers, creating an add-on is a way to test ideas and see if they resonate with a larger audience. For others, it’s the first step towards contributing to FreeCAD itself. The add-on ecosystem is hugely important for the community at large.</p><p>But many great ideas die because the add-on implementation suffers from one or more common and avoidable mistakes:</p><ul><li>Not designed to make contributions from other developers easy.</li><li>Built with implementations of things that are core FreeCAD features.</li><li>Not built with good software practices in mind, think modular code, unit tests, separation of UI and non-UI logic.</li></ul><p>This isn’t a criticism of the addon developers.  Nobody is expert in everything for many open-source contributors, writing an Add-on is their first experience contributing to a large project.</p><p>Over the last decade, I patched other people’s add-ons and wrote some of my own. In this post, I’d like to share what I think are best practices of developing 3rd-party add-ons for FreeCAD. There’s a technical and a design aspect to this.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-advice">Technical advice<a href="#technical-advice" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technical advice" title="Direct link to Technical advice">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="design-the-ui-with-qt-creator-and-use-the-ui-files-directly">Design the UI with QT Creator and use the .ui files directly.<a href="#design-the-ui-with-qt-creator-and-use-the-ui-files-directly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Design the UI with QT Creator and use the .ui files directly." title="Direct link to Design the UI with QT Creator and use the .ui files directly.">​</a></h3><p>There are several reasons why this is a great idea. First off, this makes the code simpler. Hundreds of lines of Qt code are replaced with a single line to load the .ui file like:</p><p><code>Form = FreeCADGui.PySideUic.loadUi(dialog.ui)</code></p><p>The UI logic becomes much cleaner and more testable. Secondly, UI designers are used to working with visual tools.  They can often improve the look and feel of a dialog or task panel quickly. Using the UI files directly rather than hand-coding Qt or converting the .ui file to python makes it much easier for UI designers to contribute.  The wiki has <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Manual:Creating_interface_tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lots of information</a> about designing and using .ui files.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="separate-the-ui-logic-from-the-application-logic">Separate the UI logic from the application logic.<a href="#separate-the-ui-logic-from-the-application-logic" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Separate the UI logic from the application logic." title="Direct link to Separate the UI logic from the application logic.">​</a></h3><p>From the beginning, FreeCAD was designed to run without the GUI at all.  It’s amazing how much you can do with FreeCAD by calling it from external scripts.  So it’s really frustrating to find a great piece of addon functionality that won’t work this way.</p><p>Ideally, the UI logic is separated from the rest of the application code.  Designing software this way doesn’t come naturally to amateur programmers but it isn’t too difficult and is worth learning. Even a very simple addon or workbench should have at least two Python modules, one with the logic for managing the UI, getting input from the user, and displaying it. The second module does all the interesting stuff, and it should not import FreeCADGui.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stick-with-rules-of-thumb">Stick with rules of thumb<a href="#stick-with-rules-of-thumb" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stick with rules of thumb" title="Direct link to Stick with rules of thumb">​</a></h3><p>There are some very simple rules that help keep the code clean, readable, and testable.  Like all heuristics, they aren’t written in stone and there are times to ignore them.  That said, take the time to understand why they exist.</p><p><strong>No function longer than 200 lines of code.</strong> There are various recommendations regarding the length of a function, but 200 LOC seems like a reasonable maximum. The general idea is that a function should do just one logical thing and could be explained in one sentence. This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/475762/revisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of red flags</a> for when a function is too long should serve you well (thanks to Ryan Delucchi).</p><p><strong>No module longer than 1K lines of code.</strong> For pretty much the same reason — readability, maintainability etc. — Python modules shouldn’t be too long.  Keeping python modules short has a subtle effect on code organization. It naturally encourages better encapsulation and separation of concerns, two key concepts in software development.</p><p><strong>Write pythonic code.</strong> Unlike communities around other programming languages, the Python community, is very opinionated about code conventions. Adhering to these conventions makes Python code more readable and more efficient.  Here is a <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-write-pythonic-code-208ec1513c49" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very good overview</a> by Xiaoxu Gao of what makes code in Python “pythonic”.</p><p><strong>Use Black formatting.</strong> Code formatting is sometimes a contentious issue.  Part of being ‘pythonic’ is adhering to a community standard for formatting. The standard is formalized in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PEP 8</a> which asserts a number of code style conventions.   Pycodestyle will check your code against those standards (and complain when you break them). <a href="https://github.com/psf/black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black</a> automatically reformats your Python code to comply with those conventions.</p><p><strong>Write unit tests first.</strong> Nobody likes writing unit tests but everyone likes having them.  Regressions are easy to introduce and difficult to catch. Unit tests invert that by making regressions harder to introduce and easier to solve. They also have a subtle effect on how you program. When you have to write unit tests, you start to write more testable code. So write unit tests early on to stay on top of it.</p><p><strong>Make UI translatable from day 1.</strong> Popular addons tend to get translated into other languages. Designing an addon with localization in mind from the beginning means you free yourself from redesigning it later on to introduce UI translation support.</p><p><strong>Make user-facing objects parametric.</strong> If the addon adds document objects to the project and expects the user to interact with them after creation, the important attributes of the object should be exposed through properties.  We’ve seen good ideas implemented in such a way that if the user makes an error during the creation of an object, the only recourse is to delete the object and restart.  If the creation of an object involves a task panel, double-clicking on the object in the tree should re-open the same task panel and allow the user to change settings.   FreeCAD wiki has an <a href="https://wiki.freecad.org/Create_a_FeaturePython_object_part_I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> that explains how to write FeaturePython objects the right way.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="be-on-the-lookout-for-things-that-belong-in-the-core">Be on the lookout for things that belong in the core<a href="#be-on-the-lookout-for-things-that-belong-in-the-core" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Be on the lookout for things that belong in the core" title="Direct link to Be on the lookout for things that belong in the core">​</a></h3><p>Occasionally features developed in a workbench really <em>should</em> exist in the core. A good example of that is the <a href="https://github.com/shaise/FreeCAD_SheetMetal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheetmetal workbench</a>. There’s an interesting bit of logic that unfolds a shape to produce a flattened version. The unfolder is computationally intense and would benefit from being implemented in C++ rather than Python. A powerful and efficient unfolder might also have utility in other workbenches. It sure takes more time and effort to communicate with other developers, get these things written correctly and merged, but it makes addons simpler, faster, and more maintainable.</p><p>On the other hand, be on the lookout for things that already <em>are</em> in the core. Inexperienced developers often reinvent the wheel and do it poorly. Experienced developers communicate a lot. So when you design an addon, talk to your peers and discuss your design. It could very well be the case that something you need or already exists and works just right for you.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="design-advice">Design advice<a href="#design-advice" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Design advice" title="Direct link to Design advice">​</a></h2><p>FreeCAD has the <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/stylebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beginnings of a style book</a>. While work on it is ongoing, here are some important considerations.</p><p><strong>Don&#x27;t make the user think.</strong> In free and open-source software, the concepts of usability and discoverability are often overlooked. Do your best to design an addon with a straightforward workflow that gets users from A to Z in the least possible amount of time. Give the user a result with the minimal amount of input and let them revise and improve the result incrementally. A feature that requires the user to do many things exactly right before outputting anything at all is confusing and will be ignored by most users.</p><p><strong>Chunking.</strong>  If there’s one thing you can do to make your user-interface and workflow better it is to group controls together so users can process them efficiently.</p><ul><li>Toolbars should have neither too many nor too few buttons. Seven, plus or minus two, is a guideline often invoked.</li><li>The buttons should be grouped logically.  Consider that the user may hide the toolbar or drag it to another part of the screen.  Menus should use separators to make them easier to process.</li><li>Dialogs should use group boxes, frames, and tabs to allow efficient recognition of controls.</li></ul><p><strong>Don’t just gravitate to workbenches.</strong> There seems to be a popular idea that a workbench is the right kind of addon for anything. And so there are some 3rd-party workbenches that should have been a non-workbench addon,  an extension of an existing workbench, or even a core feature. But workbenches are destinations, if you build one, you should expect that people will park there for a while and will be unwilling to jump between workbenches all the time. So when you choose what type of an addon you are creating, think primarily of workflow and tasks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-to-do-next">What to do next<a href="#what-to-do-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What to do next" title="Direct link to What to do next">​</a></h2><p>If you are planning to write a new FreeCAD addon or improve one you have already created, I recommend paying close attention to <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Developer Guide</a>.

A very popular “offender” here is the geometry constraints toolbar in Sketcher. It has 18 different constraint options, more than most popular commercial CAD offerings like Fusion 360, Onshape, and Creo. That&#x27;s not a bad thing on its own, but it adds a lot of mileage when you need to dimension an entire complex sketch.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Constraint options in FreeCAD 0.21" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-0-21-ca0c28f136d7c2b19885bcdfac503e46.webp" width="1812" height="932" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Before joining Ondsel, Pierre-Louis Boyer (@paddle) started implementing a feature called <em>contextual constraints</em> to help users constrain faster. Since joining Ondsel, he has finished the <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch</a>, and after some discussion and code review it was merged to become part of future FreeCAD 1.0. This new feature is quite nice and surpasses what many commercial CAD applicaitons are able to do. So let’s take it for a drive and kick the tires!</p><p>When you select a geometric feature in a sketch, there’s a finite number of constraints you apply once you select the second feature. For example, if you select a line and then an endpoint of another line, your most meaningful option is a distance constraint. But if you select a line and then another line that’s at an angle to the first one, the angle constraint is the most meaningful option, and your other option is to make those lines equal.</p><p>Once you know that, you can devise a system that looks at the selected features, suggests the most sensible option by default, and allows switching between possible options easily. This is what the new contextual constraints system does. It helps apply constraints based on the context of what the user has already done.  You select the new Dimension option (<strong>D</strong> shortcut) and go over your entire sketch to constraint and dimension various parts of it.</p><p>The new option combines various pre-existing other ones: constraining distances, radii, diameters, angles, and a constraint lock.</p><p>Here is a quick example. Take two lines that have different length and are at a random angle and distance to each other:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Original state" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-step-0-5d05391d314dd9eaecbd7fe30f388611.webp" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Then select the Dimension option and set the length of the first line:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Length constraint" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-step-1-427a099a5d3ab3b750234d17830273bd.webp" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Set a distance between the two lines by clicking the line and then the closer endpoint of the second line:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Distance constraint" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-step-2-0ae4fd84ec5722aee371ff45753cb326.webp" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Constraint their angle by clicking the first line and the second line:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Angle constraining" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-step-3-14968feeaf87ffcfb733e6767264ecef.webp" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>And finally make both lines equal by clicking the first line and the second line and then pressing <strong>M</strong> to switch to the second contextual constraint option:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Equal length lines" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-step-4-bd02c7fc09bd19b9a686943a532a89a4.webp" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You can constrain this sketch further by clicking on an end point of one of the lines and setting a lock, all with the same Dimension option. Most importantly, all of the steps above are completed without needing to choose a different tool in the toolbar.</p><p>For cases, when you absolutely need to have quick access to individual constraint options (just like in v0.21 and earlier), you can continue using keyboard shortcuts or selecting those options in the drop-down list:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Individual options" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-individual-options-eb9ba3a20823e766d2a23393a353714f.webp" width="1547" height="836" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preserving that possibility</a> was one of the requests from users.</p><p>The new option also allows switching between complementary angles depending on the position of the mouse:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Switching between complementary angles" src="/assets/images/contextual-constraints-complementary-angles-ab3f4c2bfba4f9f2062f4dafad2a28f0.gif" width="1792" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This implementation was possible thanks to active discussions both <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=4&amp;t=65521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the forum</a> and in the issue tracker.

We’ve talked about <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/better-github-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stale issues</a> on this blog before, and we can see in the above quote that ignored issues and PRs do have a real impact on contributor motivation and sentiment towards a project.

Maintainers that ignore PRs or let them get tangled up in dozens of comments (debating the right way to address a problem or implement a feature) can expect one-time or burned-out contributors, slower releases, and a lot of wasted effort on rebasing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-pr-is-too-large-to-effectively-review">The PR is too large to effectively review<a href="#the-pr-is-too-large-to-effectively-review" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The PR is too large to effectively review" title="Direct link to The PR is too large to effectively review">​</a></h3><p>PRs that do too many things or touch too much of the codebase at once pose a risk of unforeseen side effects.

That’s one end of the spectrum—at the other, not everyone contributing to a project has the same use cases, goals, or needs. Once the project evolves beyond its initial purpose and scope, you can end up with PRs that touch or implement an obscure feature that maintainers don’t understand or feel confident in reviewing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="competing-solutions-exist">Competing solutions exist<a href="#competing-solutions-exist" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Competing solutions exist" title="Direct link to Competing solutions exist">​</a></h3><p>There are usually multiple ways to solve a problem.

Maintainers should ensure that communication is ongoing. Using bots to bump PRs for updates helps to remind reviewers that a PR is outstanding, but also reassures the PR author that it hasn’t been forgotten (<a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/pull/8671#issuecomment-1681197585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for example</a>).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="progress-over-perfection">Progress over perfection<a href="#progress-over-perfection" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Progress over perfection" title="Direct link to Progress over perfection">​</a></h3><p>You can always iterate after merging.

But the truth is, this is a much older conversation that has been going on in the community for years now: at FOSDEM, in the forum, and in various other venues and social channels. The hackathon in Vancouver was a perfect opportunity for the developers community to set some boundaries for v1.0.</p><p>We ended up formalizing a list of <a href="https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/roadmap/next.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4 major items</a> for the v1.0 roadmap that we think are a must-have to constitute the next release. None of these items are big news, we’ve all known about them for a while: the complete topological naming fix, a default Assembly workbench, a new implementation of a materials system, and the first-run wizard.</p><p>So let’s cast a quick glance at these items and talk about respective challenges.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-toponaming-fix">The toponaming fix<a href="#the-toponaming-fix" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The toponaming fix" title="Direct link to The toponaming fix">​</a></h2><p>We’ve already discussed this topic in the past, the <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/milestone-toponaming-fix-phase-2-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest post from July</a> covers the current state of affairs in detail. It looks like we’ve already done a very difficult part of this project. Further work is not going to be easy, but the foundation for the next phases of the fix is sound.</p><p>The team is now approaching the third phase of the fix (out of five), there’s an <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/8432#issuecomment-1676433915" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">initial plan available</a>. As the third phase is where FreeCAD actually starts using the new toponaming infrastructure, this will be a perfect opportunity for new contributors to get involved. The <a href="https://t.me/toponamingchat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated Telegram chat</a> is the right place to start.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-default-assembly-workbench">The default Assembly workbench<a href="#the-default-assembly-workbench" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The default Assembly workbench" title="Direct link to The default Assembly workbench">​</a></h2><p>This is one of the more challenging items on the list of v1.0 deliverables. We think FreeCAD should have a capable assembly workbench and that really means two things:</p><ol><li>A workbench where the user configures the assembly, adding parts and establishing relationships between them.</li><li>A solver capable of resolving those relationships and moving the parts of the assembly appropriately.</li></ol><p>All that should be the default experience, no third-party add-ons.</p><p>Dr. Aik-Siong Koh, who is an employee at Ondsel, published the <a href="https://github.com/Ondsel-Development/OndselSolver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code of his solver</a> during the hackathon. This will be one of the foundations of the coming Assembly workbench.</p><p>For the user-facing assembly workbench, a lot of work remains. One of the challenges will be coming up with a user interface and workflow that are both discoverable, straightforward, and expandable. It doesn’t need to cover every use case.  Remember that the existing assembly options are still viable and may serve different users well. Rather the integrated solution should strive to be robust, simple to use, consistent with the rest of FreeCAD, and an excellent platform for future expansion.</p><p>The main challenge here will be building a team similar to the one we have for the TNP fix — a mix of Ondsel employees, FreeCAD maintainers, and 3rd party contributors. This has proven to be a great balance between interested parties, and we want to replicate that success.</p><p>The project will be managed as a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/7/views/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub project in the FreeCAD organization</a>, with cards and issues.  Similarly to the toponaming project, we’ll work in small incremental pull requests and merge the changes directly to the master branch rather than wait until the workbench is fully functional. An initial barebone implementation has already been merged to the main development branch.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="materials">Materials<a href="#materials" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Materials" title="Direct link to Materials">​</a></h2><p>The existing materials system in FreeCAD is overly simplistic, all over the place, and doesn’t even scratch the surface of what users really need it to do. So the program absolutely needs a solid foundation.</p><p>Earlier this year, we posted an <a href="https://ondsel.com/blog/freecad-needs-a-better-materials-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">implementation proposal</a> for a new materials system written in collaboration with Dave Carter who volunteered to actually do the work. Dave is, in fact, knee-deep in that project and has made a lot of progress (the branch with his code is <a href="https://github.com/davesrocketshop/FreeCAD/tree/post_21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public</a>). Moreover, users have been <a href="https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=78242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very supportive</a> of his effort.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Editor for new material cards" src="/assets/images/materials-new-cards-editor-b1bae2dd4b5c40eea6bc33c2082c6ca8.webp" width="837" height="574" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The first pull request <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has already been filed</a> and is undergoing review. Further plan with materials is to apply the toponaming development model: break all further work down into small pieces, so that any developer could be part of that effort. Once the initial patch has been merged and further work has been decomposed into small items, more developers can join the effort. All further work will be done in pull requests. This will make it possible to deliver the minimum viable implementation in time for v1.0.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-run-wizard">First-run wizard<a href="#first-run-wizard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to First-run wizard" title="Direct link to First-run wizard">​</a></h2><p>FreeCAD has a difficult learning curve. Improving the initial user experiences is a topic that resurfaces regularly. We even covered that in a recent blog post. Here is the gist of the issue.</p><p>First of all, people can’t really agree on the scope of the first-run wizard. There are literally dozens of settings that users requested to be editable when you run the program for the first time. But when you dig deeper into the reasoning, several things become obvious.</p><p>First there are configuration settings for which a single default will never suffice. Language and the unit system are the two that come to mind.</p><p>Some configuration options appear to be personal preference but might also have more significant usability implications. For example themes and colors are personal preference, but they become extremely important if you suffer from color deficiency.  Users will never agree with each other about that, so those have to be easily configurable. </p><p>Other things that people want to configure should probably be solved in other ways. A great example of this is configuring which workbenches are available and active for a new user.
Should the system present a bewildering array of workbenches to a new user or should it hide potentially useful tools in an effort to be streamlined? Reasonable people disagree. In this case, the right answer might be to improve the Start workbench. This would provide a fast track to the workbench based on that task that they need to accomplish. Initial mockup was created and then turned into a <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull request</a> by Qewer during the hackathon. This patch has already been accepted and will be part of v1.0.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Updated start screen" src="/assets/images/updated-start-screen-43314754a338a6b5419904668bee5343.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>On yet another level, this is a conversation about terminology. A much-discussed example here is the distinction between Part and PartDesign — users inevitably learn to understand the difference, but they are off to a rocky start, and there are some technical issues to take care of on the developers’ part.</p><p>Hence the plan is to come up with a minimal implementation of the first-run wizard, one that would deal with things that users are split over regardless of how sensible defaults are, and then see take a holistic approach to dealing with the rest.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="and-now-the-fun-part-can-we-get-v10-out-by-fosdem-2024">And now the fun part: can we get v1.0 out by FOSDEM 2024?<a href="#and-now-the-fun-part-can-we-get-v10-out-by-fosdem-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to And now the fun part: can we get v1.0 out by FOSDEM 2024?" title="Direct link to And now the fun part: can we get v1.0 out by FOSDEM 2024?">​</a></h2><p>We think that these goals are within reach and it should be possible to release FreeCAD 1.0 in time for the next FOSDEM. Here’s our thinking behind this goal.</p><p>The TNP fix and the new Materials system are at the stage where the nature and the amount of work yet to be done are fairly predictable, and a large part of the heavy-lifting has already been done.</p><p>The initial Assembly workbench will be a challenging project, but now that we have a solver, we can start working on designing UX/UI around common use cases.</p><p>The design and the implementation of the first-run wizard itself would be a minor development effort, and there are people in the community who already spent a considerable amount of time creating mockups and even writing code. The challenging part will be taking a holistic approach to dealing with configuration and improving initial user experience, but we can make this effort span across multiple releases, there is so much to improve anyway.</p><p>To reiterate, v1.0 will definitely have changes apart from these 4 items. What we are aiming for is to start making development more predictable. Gaining some focus will help the team with both planning their work and managing expectations of FreeCAD users.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/development">development</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-1d4df470ffd929076b7ae604f6c49878.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/dont-lose-your-open-source-soul">Don’t lose your (open-source) soul: Why we founded Ondsel as a Public Benefit Company</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 1, 2023</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><blockquote><p>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
-Mark 8:36</p></blockquote><p>Late last year I was talking with <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Core Ventures</a> about the possibility of starting Ondsel.  It was exciting to hear from people outside the FreeCAD community who shared the vision that this software was important and could be so much more than it already is.   As the idea of actually starting a company took hold,  the first important decision was which legal structure the new company would have.  Two things that I read deeply affected me and shaped the final decision.</p><p>The first was <a href="https://www.cooleygo.com/delaware-public-benefit-corporation-is-it-right-for-you-a-five-part-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article by Jen Barnette that highlighted five considerations for being a public benefits corporation</a> (PBC).</p><p>At a time when ambition often clashes with integrity, the formation of Ondsel as a Public Benefit Company (PBC) should stand as a testament to our belief in conscious entrepreneurship. The ethos of open-source software, characterized by collaboration and transparency, frequently finds itself at odds with the profit-driven dynamics of the modern tech landscape. Ondsel&#x27;s genesis as a PBC exemplifies a commitment to upholding the soul of open-source values, even in the pursuit of success.
Open-source software, a cornerstone of the digital age, embodies the spirit of sharing, transparency, and collective betterment. But, as projects mature, they can wrestle with the challenges of sustainability. Developers who once dedicated themselves to a project out of love find their efforts ensnared by financial considerations and proprietary boundaries, straying from the core essence of openness. Ondsel&#x27;s inception as a PBC is a direct response—a proactive stance to prevent the dilution of these core values.
The five points that Jen described meshed well with my own thinking and I made sure to include them in <a href="https://ondsel.com/docs/handbook/About/public_benefit_corp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our own handbook</a>.  I revisit them often to make sure my thinking doesn’t drift away from the core values we started with.</p><p>The second thing I read was Simon Sinek’s book <a href="https://simonsinek.com/books/the-infinite-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Infinite Game</em></a>.  He suggests that a company should have a “just cause”  that inspires people because it explains <em>why</em> you’re doing what you do.</p><p>For me, this one was easy.
Human beings are creative and social creatures. Not everyone creates physical things but Everyone is a maker of ideas. We enjoy sharing our ideas, talking about them and improving them. Sometimes those ideas turn into physical things that have beauty, utility, and value.  These days, you need tools to express your ideas so others can build on them and we need everyone’s best ideas.
People deserve access to tools to help them express their ideas, share them with other people, and use them to produce useful things that benefit all of us.  Ondsel wants to make powerful, efficient, and beautiful design tools available to more people.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ondsel">Ondsel</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-937b8ceecfc87f17e3d9a3e5d92f2482.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/freecad-needs-a-first-run-wizard">FreeCAD needs a first-run wizard, but nobody knows what it should do</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-08-27T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 27, 2023</time> · <!-- -->13 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/prokoudine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57467?v=4" alt="Alexandre Prokoudine"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/prokoudine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Alexandre Prokoudine</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Contributing Writer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>FreeCAD is commonly criticized for being difficult to get started with. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quote 1" src="/assets/images/quote1-62e8e4811650f6e6373d08f546f83e18.webp" width="1421" height="199" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quote 2" src="/assets/images/quote2-9bdfb35d09fdf1d321bb9843df2bbe1f.webp" width="1421" height="199" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This criticism, while possibly overstated, is valid.</p><ul><li>Features get more development attention and the UX/UI design is usually an afterthought and “anything goes”. As a result, there’s not much consistency across the program.</li><li>The learning curve for modern CAD systems is a wall. There is even occasionally pushback against simplifying UX, because “CAD programs are <em>supposed</em> to be difficult and take a lot of time to learn&quot;. Effort to improve UI is seen as &quot;dumbing it down”.</li><li>The program is trying to be many things at once: a 2D drafting program, a 3D design program, an Arch/BIM program, a CNC program, a structural analysis program — and that’s just a subset of workbenches available by default. All the while not much thought has been given to help users navigate the options when they see it for the first time, or customize FreeCAD for their use cases.</li><li>Terminology used in the program is inconsistent and confusing. Part vs PartDesign is one of the recurring topics in the community. But also “path” could mean a toolpath, a sweep path, or a file path depending on where in the program the word is used. These are just a couple examples.</li></ul><p>For a long time there have been calls for a first-run wizard (FRW) as the way to fix some of these problems. If you are not familiar with the concept, the idea behind FRW is a feature that runs the first time a user launches a program and helps orient the user to the software by allowing them to choose how the program will look and behave or by onboarding them in other ways.</p><p>While investigating this feature request, we looked into what other programs have to offer, and our conclusion is that while something is needed, this request is problematic and the specific solution has poor consensus.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-wrong-with-the-feature-request">What’s wrong with the feature request?<a href="#whats-wrong-with-the-feature-request" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s wrong with the feature request?" title="Direct link to What’s wrong with the feature request?">​</a></h2><p>First and foremost, the <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/5772" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue</a> is poorly defined. This issue predates the current contributing policy, it doesn’t start by identifying the problem but jumps immediately to the solution. People have seen similar solutions in other applications and have an intuition about them. But the notion of a first-run wizard brings different ideas to mind. In fact, our research showed that these tools are employed to address at least three different problems:</p><ul><li>User preferences make a big difference to usability but the settings are difficult to find or scattered in many places.</li><li>The optimum configuration of the software varies depending on the specific task the user is undertaking.</li><li>Important features are occasionally overlooked by users leading to frustration and increased support demand on the forum.</li></ul><p>These are three very different problems and their solutions are unlikely to be the same thing. It makes sense to address them independently.</p><p>Even if we narrow the focus and assume the feature request is only about customizing the software for the user’s needs, we still have a challenge. Consider this bewildering list of things that people have suggested should be configurable when you first run FreeCAD. We call it The Problematic Wishlist:</p><ul><li>Simple vs advanced layout (e.g. don’t show FEM workbench to a newbie, show less buttons in toolbars etc.)</li><li>Which workbenches (WBs) should be visible in the UI, with presets (Mechanical CAD, Arch/BIM etc.)</li><li>What WB is selected on startup</li><li>UI language</li><li>Units and unit schemes</li><li>Theme (dark/light/classic)</li><li>Enabling/disabling Treeview Glass theme</li><li>Icon theme</li><li>Highlight color</li><li>Icon size</li><li>Font size</li><li>Viewport background color</li><li>Navigation style</li><li>Enabling/disabling warnings in weekly builds</li><li>Enabling/disabling “What’s This?” button</li><li>Monitor aspect ratio selection for optimized layouts</li><li>Panel layout options</li><li>Default file storage location</li><li>Autosave and backup policy</li><li>Authoring and license info</li></ul><p>While it may be technically possible to implement all this in a first-run wizard,  it would be a perfect example of creating a bigger problem by trying to fix a smaller one.  It would be overwhelming to the user trying to get started and would complicate development since configuration would have to be maintained in both the FRW and the system preferences.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-other-programs-do">What other programs do<a href="#what-other-programs-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What other programs do" title="Direct link to What other programs do">​</a></h2><p>As part of the research phase, we looked at what other programs offer in terms of customizing UX the first time you run a program. The question we asked was just this: do other teams solve the same issues by offering a first-run wizard or do they do something else?</p><p>We started with CAD programs and then moved to other kinds of applications (3D modeling, image editing, vector graphics editing, audio production). Basically, any sophisticated program with lots of configuration options, aimed at professionals and designed for multiple use cases is worth looking at.</p><p>Right off the bat, among non-FOSS <strong>CAD</strong> packages, only BricsCAD provides something that vaguely approaches a first-run wizard. Every time you launch the program, a dialog asks what kind of work the user wants to do: 2D drafting, 3D modeling, mechanical design, or BIM. The same launcher window also asks whether the user wants metric or imperial units. And this is it. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Start screen in BricsCAD" src="/assets/images/bricscad-start-screen-7fab41fb6de424cef5f34bb217272b6b.webp" width="1420" height="946" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>But you don’t even need a dialog for that. Multiple programs provide a simple choice over the type of project you create. In some cases, it’s just a drop-down list of project types or a library of templates.</p><p>The only two programs that do have a first-run wizard are FOSS programs. LibreCAD asks for the default unit, GUI language, and command language. QCad asks for GUI language, default unit, default paper size, decimal point, and background color (black or white). Not too surprising, as the former is a fork of the latter.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="First-run wizard in LibreCAD" src="/assets/images/librecad-frw-3615f4974dfd0420b3b3bb9927b8051a.webp" width="1102" height="484" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The situation is pretty much the same across other industries we looked at.</p><p>Blender seems to be the only major <strong>3D modeling</strong> package that has a first-run wizard. You can set UI language, shortcuts preset, right-click vs left-click for selection, spacebar behavior, UI theme.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="First-run wizard in Blender" src="/assets/images/blender-frw-82c25b3c77508dffe5df53091f099492.webp" width="884" height="825" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>None of the big boys in <strong>image editing</strong>, like Adobe Photoshop and Affinity Photo, have a first-run wizard. Ironically, GIMP is the program that used to have one, got rid of it, but is likely to have one again. In short, the original wizard asked questions that could be automatically detected from various system settings, and users found it annoying. But then developers made changes to defaults (enforced default dark theme and symbolic/colorless icons, as well as grouped tool icons in the toolbar), and that, too, annoyed half the user base. So they want to reintroduce the first-run wizard at some point in the future.</p><p>Similarly, Inkscape seems to be the only <strong>vector graphics</strong> program with a first-run wizard: you can choose canvas look (transparent checkerboard, white opaque etc.), shortcuts theme, icons theme, dark vs system UI theme.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="First-run wizard in Inkscape" src="/assets/images/inkscape-frw-7f8a721255348eae90c578fa4febd3d3.webp" width="1403" height="1333" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Among proprietary <strong>digital audio workstations</strong> Cubase seems to be the only one that bothers users with questions, and even that during installation when you need to select a preferred audio interface. Once again, a FOSS program is an exception: the first time you run Ardour, a wizard asks for GUI and font scaling and the default folder for new sessions. The first part of that, however, is a toolkit limitation. Ardour still uses GTK2 for some part of its UI, and GTK2 is notoriously oblivious of HiDPI displays.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="First-run wizard in Ardour" src="/assets/images/ardour-frw-681f780085b156b00152d296962d0466.webp" width="760" height="542" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Across many industries, developers recognize that learning to use their software efficiently takes time, so they build links to training materials into the user interface. This is something FOSS developers are beginning to do, too. For example, MuseScore has links to educational videos on YouTube, and FreeCAD has links to the wiki.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Learning center in MuseScore" src="/assets/images/musescore-learning-center-76599ccbe989c6d526f0472515bbad3e.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So what did we learn from this?</p><ul><li><strong>Very few programs actually provide a first-run wizard.</strong> Proprietary programs typically enforce a certain choice of defaults even for controversial things like the look and feel, but, to their credit, usually make it rather easy to customize certain things.</li><li><strong>There are obvious polarizing topics.</strong> Some of the defaults are things that users just can’t stop arguing about. This is exactly what first-run wizards in FOSS programs like Blender and Inkscape focus on.</li><li><strong>Measure units surprisingly do not cause all that much controversy.</strong> Figuring out the right units from locale settings is perfectly doable, so it’s possible that this is why very few CAD programs even bother exposing those when you run them the first time or create a new project. Typically, there is a global configuration that applies to new projects and a simple way to override it on a per-project basis (an unfinished patch for the latter <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exists</a> for FreeCAD).</li><li><strong>There’s usually a very obvious way to get to the right tools.</strong> Applications like Inventor make it very easy to create a 2D design or a 3D model. Usually, it’s just one or two clicks away, and the UI for that is in a very obvious place.</li><li><strong>CAD programs usually have a learning center for newly arrived users.</strong> This is something FreeCAD already does, but there are ways to improve it. A topic for another day.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Learning center in Autocad LT" src="/assets/images/autocad-lt-learning-center-01cdd9a60a51c2e7812d8769545c5c43.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-proposal">Our proposal<a href="#our-proposal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our proposal" title="Direct link to Our proposal">​</a></h2><p>Based on our findings, we think it’s best to attack the issue of suboptimal first user experience from three angles: minimal first-run wizard, better defaults, and continuous UX/UI improvement.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="minimal-first-run-wizard">Minimal first-run wizard<a href="#minimal-first-run-wizard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Minimal first-run wizard" title="Direct link to Minimal first-run wizard">​</a></h3><p>Let’s learn from the experience of other projects. Right-click selection in Blender was a huge annoyance for new users right up to the point where left-click selection was finally implemented and the first-run wizard started offering the choice between the two options. The lesson here is that there will always be things that users are split over, we are not going to change everyone’s mind, ever.</p><p>Therefore the first part of the solution is to build a minimalistic first-run wizard that will cover just that: visual style, navigation style, units, GUI language. We can further refine the wizard based on feedback from users. Designing and implementing the dialog is not too complicated, and there have been several approaches to do so already.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="better-defaults">Better defaults<a href="#better-defaults" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Better defaults" title="Direct link to Better defaults">​</a></h3><p>Certain things on the wishlist above could absolutely be better defaults. For example, we can enable backups by default and set a sensible number of versions to be saved.</p><p>The tricky part here is coming up with a definition of what constitutes a sensible default. This is something we will have to further explore.</p><p>In our experience, it’s useful to keep each conversation about defaults narrowly focused. For example, we’ve already had a lively if slightly heated discussion over disabling some of the workbenches in the workbench selector by default. Breaking that conversation into several dedicated GitHub issues has helped to keep the discussion productive, so now there is a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub project</a> for cleaning up the workbench selector.</p><p>This task of making good defaults will likely never be 100% completed as FreeCAD keeps changing. So we should treat it as a continuous effort.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="continuous-uxui-improvement">Continuous UX/UI improvement<a href="#continuous-uxui-improvement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Continuous UX/UI improvement" title="Direct link to Continuous UX/UI improvement">​</a></h3><p>This last part of the solution is a lot more interesting. Let’s analyze the rest and see how we can improve the UX/UI to deliver a better initial user experience and maybe remove the need for configuring certain things when users run the program for the first time.</p><p>Here is an example. One of the ideas for the first-run wizard is to allow users to configure what workbenches they want visible by default. To reiterate, someone who, for all we know, is probably looking at the program for the first time, is supposed to somehow guess what workbenches they actually need without having ever used them. That doesn’t sound like a very likely scenario.</p><p>And then some experienced users could have different uses for the program. You can be an architect who needs Draft, Arch/BIM, and just a few more WBs. But you also tinker with stuff in your spare time, so PartDesign and Path are no strangers to you.</p><p>Basically, FreeCAD needs to adapt the UI based on context. There are several established approaches to deal with that. Named workspaces is one of them. But another approach is to improve the start screen. If you create an architectural project, you automatically get a certain set of workbenches available to you. You can further refine that selection, if you want to, but the default user experience will already be streamlined for you to a large extent based on the type of a project you create.</p><p>The first step towards that has already been done. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Qewer</a>, v1.0 will be coming with an update start screen listing several typical new projects that are basically a fast track to a particular workbench.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="New start page in FreeCAD" src="/assets/images/freecad-new-start-page-8504802fe5942707cae5aaa1488034ec.webp" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The full implementation of that would eliminate two items from the wishlist: 1) what WBs should be visible in the UI, and 2) what WB is selected on startup.</p><p>This kind of a holistic approach to designing UX/UI should serve the project much better than what we have had so far. We also don’t have to deliver the full UX/UI redesign of FreeCAD for v1.0, this kind of refinement can go on for as many development cycles as we can handle.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next" title="Direct link to What’s next">​</a></h2><p>Improving the user’s initial experience of FreeCAD is not a single work effort.  There has been good work done in this area already including an <a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/5772" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing discussion</a> about the first-run wizard in the issue tracker, but discrete, solvable issues need to be extracted from that and solutions built for each of them.</p><p>The first issue to address is the narrowly defined set of configuration options  which users routinely disagree about: language, units, navigation style, and theme.</p><p>Tailoring the application to the task should be addressed by improving the start page and providing better defaults whenever possible.  As noted above, some work has already been done.</p><p>That leaves the more subjective work of explicitly educating the user about FreeCAD conventions, UI tools, shortcuts, and the general UX/UI improvements.   Both of these need more research and feedback from the community. This is an area where we need better and more actionable data from community power users and moderators about where users are confused.</p><p>There will likely be a GitHub project focusing on UX/UI cleanup. Stay tuned for more news on that.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/freecad">freecad</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/development">development</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer bg-transparent footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col flex footer-layout"><div><div class="footer__title">Contact Us</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/ondsel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="mailto:contact@ondsel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">contact@ondsel.com<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ondsel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">facebook<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="col footer__col flex footer-layout"><div><div class="footer__title">FreeCAD</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://freecad.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Website<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/FreeCAD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="footer__bottom copy_right text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 Ondsel, Inc. </div></div></div></footer></div>
