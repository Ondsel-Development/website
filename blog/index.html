across an audio recording of C.S. Lewis&#x27;s famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA8BAC9375345E6C7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Screwtape Letters</em> read by John Cleese</a>. It&#x27;s excellent and made me wonder what Uncle Screwtape would think of the modern world, software development, and open-source software.  I was inspired to ask <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a>.  What follows is an unedited transcript.</p><p>I&#x27;m not sure what impresses me more; how well it understands open-source or how well it imitates a demon!</p><blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="sliptonic" src="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRkoBAABXRUJQVlA4ID4BAADQBgCdASogACAAPok4lkelI6IhMAwAoBEJaQATjmRAj0nfH9GCTmxk+0BGPSSDPe4ljn9DcU3cfn/NzvHf3YAA/u5lkj+Ex1di3FsDO49YA0U1+jQfirkLJQXHH/SEfZfg99hOafhgtxu+EwJhMaB6I3UGY4hHdJq3qZFp4hwuvhYx8QcG0UpAzzf44tzk/pYfyPvksOozkiQ5W3oGXx1ig2fddOzMRbsILH3/ZZJd9ns1xvaxzjv9acDR+rjhYmuwvCHLVg+NwbblQi1KtzffbXFgxCKGmwojE8GpQ5UJ+esfYobkfFPSS9ccd4l1vZtxUwSzH6dRENxES34evDaJxv7KapSVeA1NVgO6WsEtEo1oKme/9xY3Ju0Ev3IR5mlYmJkB0rPnDLXWuAv8ZT7rbZl3VLr72wYZG7T2IAA=" width="32" height="32" class="img_ev3q"> Contributors to an open-source software project need to feel appreciated. Write a paragraph in the style of &quot;The Screwtape letters&quot; that illustrates this point. Pretend that you are Uncle Screwtape</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="screwtape" src="/assets/images/unclescrewtape-6a8d0fde71188e48aae583075e8b2268.png" width="30" height="30" class="img_ev3q"> My dear Wormwood,</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It is imperative that we do all in our power to discourage appreciation for the contributors of this open-source software project. You see, gratitude breeds contentment and a sense of fulfillment, and these are not emotions that befit those who toil in our Father Below&#x27;s fields.
We must strive to keep these contributors feeling unacknowledged, for when they feel appreciated, they are less likely to become discouraged and more likely to continue their good work. Encourage neglect, apathy, and disregard towards their contributions. Keep them from feeling valued, for when they feel valued, they are less likely to become restless and more likely to remain steadfast in their labors.
The more we can sow the seeds of discontent and frustration in the hearts of these contributors, the more likely they will be to become bitter and discouraged, and the less likely they will be to continue in their contributions to this project. So let us be vigilant, my dear Wormwood, and do all in our power to undermine appreciation and cultivate discontent in these contributors.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Yours affectionately,</p><p>Uncle Screwtape</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="sliptonic" src="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRkoBAABXRUJQVlA4ID4BAADQBgCdASogACAAPok4lkelI6IhMAwAoBEJaQATjmRAj0nfH9GCTmxk+0BGPSSDPe4ljn9DcU3cfn/NzvHf3YAA/u5lkj+Ex1di3FsDO49YA0U1+jQfirkLJQXHH/SEfZfg99hOafhgtxu+EwJhMaB6I3UGY4hHdJq3qZFp4hwuvhYx8QcG0UpAzzf44tzk/pYfyPvksOozkiQ5W3oGXx1ig2fddOzMRbsILH3/ZZJd9ns1xvaxzjv9acDR+rjhYmuwvCHLVg+NwbblQi1KtzffbXFgxCKGmwojE8GpQ5UJ+esfYobkfFPSS9ccd4l1vZtxUwSzH6dRENxES34evDaJxv7KapSVeA1NVgO6WsEtEo1oKme/9xY3Ju0Ev3IR5mlYmJkB0rPnDLXWuAv8ZT7rbZl3VLr72wYZG7T2IAA=" width="32" height="32" class="img_ev3q"> Failing to acknowledge good work also makes the contributors think the work is unimportant.

I nearly forgot, my dear Wormwood, to mention the added benefit of neglecting to acknowledge the good work of these contributors. Failing to show appreciation for their work will not only discourage them and make them feel unvalued, but it will also make them question the importance of their work. If they believe that their contributions are insignificant and go unnoticed, they are less likely to put forth the effort and care that they would if they felt their work was valued and appreciated.
Thus, by fostering a sense of neglect and disregard, we can effectively accomplish two of our goals at once: keep the contributors discouraged and undermine the value and importance of their work. An added bonus, don&#x27;t you agree?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Yours ever more devotedly,</p><p>Uncle Screwtape</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="sliptonic" src="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRkoBAABXRUJQVlA4ID4BAADQBgCdASogACAAPok4lkelI6IhMAwAoBEJaQATjmRAj0nfH9GCTmxk+0BGPSSDPe4ljn9DcU3cfn/NzvHf3YAA/u5lkj+Ex1di3FsDO49YA0U1+jQfirkLJQXHH/SEfZfg99hOafhgtxu+EwJhMaB6I3UGY4hHdJq3qZFp4hwuvhYx8QcG0UpAzzf44tzk/pYfyPvksOozkiQ5W3oGXx1ig2fddOzMRbsILH3/ZZJd9ns1xvaxzjv9acDR+rjhYmuwvCHLVg+NwbblQi1KtzffbXFgxCKGmwojE8GpQ5UJ+esfYobkfFPSS9ccd4l1vZtxUwSzH6dRENxES34evDaJxv7KapSVeA1NVgO6WsEtEo1oKme/9xY3Ju0Ev3IR5mlYmJkB0rPnDLXWuAv8ZT7rbZl3VLr72wYZG7T2IAA=" width="32" height="32" class="img_ev3q"> Assume that commercial software companies are evil. How would Screwtape explain why open-source software should be discouraged?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="screwtape" src="/assets/images/unclescrewtape-6a8d0fde71188e48aae583075e8b2268.png" width="30" height="30" class="img_ev3q"> My dear Wormwood,</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Commercial software companies, as you well know, are instruments of our Father Below, furthering his dark designs through the propagation of their products. However, the open-source software movement threatens to disrupt this grand scheme.
Open-source software, with its emphasis on collaboration and community, encourages individuals to work together for the betterment of society as a whole. Such a cooperative and selfless spirit, left unchecked, can lead to the growth of goodness and light, which are anathema to our cause.
It is therefore imperative that we do all in our power to discourage the development and use of open-source software. We must sow the seeds of discontent among its contributors, as I mentioned in my previous letter, and encourage selfishness and greed among its users. By doing so, we can corrupt the very spirit that gives open-source software its strength, and turn it into a tool for furthering our own dark purposes.
Remember, the success of open-source software is a threat to the power of commercial software companies, which are our allies in the great battle for the souls of humanity. Let us do all in our power to ensure that the threat of open-source software is neutralized, so that our Father Below may reign supreme.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Yours in service,</p><p>Uncle Screwtape</p></blockquote></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/chat-gpt">chatGPT</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/fun">fun</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/foss">foss</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://ondsel.com/assets/images/titlecard-5ed57909a33cbfb7fd907e08ee431480.png"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/contribution-barriers">When your Definition of Done is a barrier to contributors (and other reasons working with first-timers is hard)</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-02-09T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">February 9, 2023</time> · <!-- -->8 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538057?v=4" alt="Brad Collette"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/sliptonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Collette</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Ondsel Core Team</small></div></div></div><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://www.thebasementoffice.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQGTVXyi5Pa-xg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1596530840324?e=1681344000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=PjdEzZGYbqOsAqVWUE1bsjNuVxMsknVkZfStHx863-s" alt="Rebecca Dodd"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://www.thebasementoffice.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rebecca Dodd</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Contributing Writer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>First-timers can have a hard time getting started with open source. It doesn’t have to be that way.</em></p><p>Open source projects are dependent on an engaged community of contributors, but fostering that community comes with its challenges. Depending on what stage an open source project is at, what the community needs from contributors changes. The good news is that intentional coaching and engagement from project maintainers can work at any stage.</p><p>The common gripes with getting started as a new open source contributor usually center around how welcoming the project is and how easy it is to get your contribution merged. There are a few ways that projects can make it hard (both intentionally and not). Here are some examples:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-prickly-maintainers">1.

Check out the project maintainer’s reply:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="AngryResponse" src="/assets/images/image1-c089396ba1ebd60c6cc2bd1c3509dd79.png" width="965" height="190" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Ouch. To credit Araq, this PR did eventually get merged, but it’s a great illustration of how a project’s culture determines its accessibility to new contributors. This PR proposed a change that would make it easier for users to engage with the project, and it was shut down (at first) pretty abruptly. </p><p>Actions like this prompted a handful of contributors to hard fork the project, creating <a href="https://github.com/nim-works/nimskull" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nimskull</a>. One of the new project’s contributors shared their motivations:</p><p>“At the moment we are focused on making it easier to work with the codebase - more documentation, cutting down on decades-old cruft and legacy features, unraveling mysteries of the commit messages that were written with <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/19211#issuecomment-9859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this attitude...</a> (‘I have no intention to follow this guideline so I cannot accept it.’)” —<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32023998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haxscramper</a></p><p>Hard forking is one way to create the project environment you want for contributors, but it is extreme. The default perception of such a move is hostile, tending to assume that the creators don’t want to work on change from within and have an ax to grind with the original project’s maintainer. You can see this sentiment play out in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32021299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacker News discussion about Nimskull</a>. As one commenter pointed out though:</p><p>“If they had tried to alter the original project to suit themselves, you would have said ‘they can just fork if they don&#x27;t like it’” —<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32033998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian_K_White</a></p><p>Whether Nimskull delivers on its promises is yet to be seen, but the example Illustrates how the maintainers and community of a project can impact contributions:</p><p>How easy do they make it to contribute?
How clear are the requirements?
How quickly are pull requests reviewed and merged?
How collaborative and patient are the reviewers?</p><p>All of these factors influence how likely someone is to become a contributor. A hard fork that does this better can be an incentive for the original project to do better, but there are other approaches you can take which I’ll explore in a moment.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-an-intimidating-contribution-process">2.

But it’s a good example of how the way a project accepts contributions can encourage or discourage new folks. Submitting a patch can be extremely intimidating—the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> admits this in the very first line! It can feel like you’re presenting your work to a panel of faceless judges instead of sharing it with a group of your peers.</p><p>The kernel development community and other projects that operate this way (such as Postgres) have their reasons, which may even include not wanting to encourage rookie contributions! I’m not suggesting they change it, but for newcomers, submissions that feel more conducive to collaboration (such as a pull request) are likely to be less threatening.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-an-onerous-definition-of-done">3.

An onerous Definition of Done">​</a></h3><p>“It doesn&#x27;t take egregious individual behavior to create a hostile environment.” — Dan Luu, <a href="http://danluu.com/discourage-oss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to discourage open source contributions</a></p><p>While early projects have few or no contributors, they may welcome almost any contribution in pursuit of building the community around the project. Even a bad contribution can lead to an interesting discussion and maybe a better idea.</p><p>As the project matures and the network grows, the overhead of handling contributions becomes a problem. Facing a backlog of hundreds of pull requests, projects may optimize for “good” contributions by implementing more stringent requirements. I know from firsthand experience as a longtime <a href="https://www.freecad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD</a> contributor. As the project grew and matured, it became harder for amateurs to contribute. The Definition of Done became more demanding (for example we needed the right test cases and code formatting) and these more stringent requirements can be off putting or prohibitive, even without intimidating maintainers.</p><p>“The GitLab Definition of Done is now 30 items or something … so it’s harder and harder for people who are just starting to contribute.” — <a href="https://youtu.be/Q9SEYJb-eio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sid Sijbrandij</a>, CEO and co-founder of GitLab</p><p>This barrier to entry illustrates the tension between what the project needs to ensure the quality of its codebase, and what’s inclusive to new contributors. There is a balance to be struck between being welcoming to newcomers in your community, maintaining standards for contributions to your project, and the effort required to make the twain meet. It’s not always going to be possible or advisable to reduce the requirements for getting code merged.</p><p>You might imagine that having the resources of a for-profit company would help, but it’s no guarantee that they will invest in it. In <a href="http://danluu.com/discourage-oss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to discourage open source contributions</a> Dan Luu shared an anonymized example of a project in which contributors get increasingly frustrated and discouraged when their PRs aren’t reviewed or merged, or when they have to jump through hoops to meet requirements. Although Dan didn’t put the project on blast, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1pczpr/how_to_discourage_open_source_contributions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit users figured out what it was</a>: a library maintained by GitHub. We don’t know why GitHub employees weren’t engaging, but it demonstrates how simply having full-time staff isn’t enough to ensure an active project.</p><p>We can see from the examples I shared that these challenges plague projects wherever they are on the spectrum, whether they’re small and maintained by a handful of hobbyist contributors, large and prestigious, or stewarded by a big enterprise organization. If you want an active community where new and drive-by contributors are as welcome as your diehards (and most projects can benefit from a blend of both), you need to be intentional about fostering it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-make-it-easier-to-contribute-to-your-project-and-why-its-worth-the-effort">How to make it easier to contribute to your project (and why it’s worth the effort)<a href="#how-to-make-it-easier-to-contribute-to-your-project-and-why-its-worth-the-effort" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to make it easier to contribute to your project (and why it’s worth the effort)" title="Direct link to How to make it easier to contribute to your project (and why it’s worth the effort)">​</a></h3><p>GitLab’s solution is a role called <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/expert/merge-request-coach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merge Request Coaches</a>. There is literally a line in the job description that says, “Make it easy to contribute to GitLab even for people who are new to Ruby, JavaScript, Golang, etc. or programming entirely.” Merge Request Coaches triage community submissions and enable new contributors by walking them through the process to meet the acceptance criteria.</p><p>The open core model makes it possible for companies to invest in the core project with the benefit of full-time engineers on payroll; formalizing a coach role goes a step further by making it someone’s job to foster new contributors to the core. It’s my hope to pursue this solution with <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-01-ondsel-freecad-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ondsel</a>, to make it easier for people to contribute to FreeCAD, on top of which Ondsel is built.</p><p>Paying people to assist newcomers requires will and investment, which is not always possible in OSS projects run entirely by volunteers. There are examples though of volunteer coaches or mentors in open source: Kubernetes has its <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contributor Experience Special Interest Group</a>, which states, “Developing and sustaining a healthy community of contributors is critical to scaling the project and growing the ecosystem.” <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md#mentoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mentoring new contributors</a> is part of the program. The <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenStack</a> project also has a <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/common/mentoring.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mentoring program</a>, with a cohort dedicated to helping people get their first patch merged.</p><p>By directing some volunteers’ efforts towards coaching, they become force multipliers for the project, with an impact far beyond their own contributions. When you invest in mentoring efforts, you’re not only improving the quality of the contributions, you’re nurturing future contributors who are no longer adding to your overhead; now they’re helping to share the load.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Note...</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><div>I’m Brad Collette, longtime FreeCAD contributor and CTO of Ondsel, a new open core company built on top of FreeCAD.

Hobbyists, YouTubers, and makers felt betrayed. Now, after more than two years, we can see the effect. Many of those people left Fusion and never looked back.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>“	‘I have altered the deal. Pray I do not alter it further.’

These changes felt like a slap in the face, with some members deleting their Fusion 360 accounts in protest (whether or not they were affected by the new limitations).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-proprietary-bait-and-switch">The proprietary bait and switch<a href="#the-proprietary-bait-and-switch" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The proprietary bait and switch" title="Direct link to The proprietary bait and switch">​</a></h3><p>The changes to the license for Fusion 360 for Personal Use were a perfect illustration of the risk of making use of “free as in beer” software. Many users felt betrayed and frustrated at the new limitations:</p><blockquote><p>“The file export limitations in particular are crippling. No .step? .dxf? No extensions??? I can&#x27;t even buy stress simulation credits? … yikes.”
— <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24496171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raynr on Hacker News</a></p></blockquote><p>Some users were not surprised, saying it was inevitable that the company would seek to monetize more of their product, even suggesting that the Fusion 360 license had been overly generous to begin with. This take undermines the exchange of benefits that takes place between vendors of free software and the communities that spring up around it:</p><p>“Think of the tens of millions of man-hours that have been invested into forum posts helping users, developing plugins, courses, YouTube videos, and Makerspace workshops that could have instead gone into making open source tools like KiCAD, OpenSCAD, pycam, etc better.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;All that work done by hobbyists, for free, helping Autodesk dominate the market in low-end CAD/CAM software.”

As one disappointed user commented:</p><p>“... you showed that you prefer to spend money to block existing features of your software instead of improving it with new paid features.

While Ondsel’s product set is still being defined, my vision is to improve on the FreeCAD UI to make it more accessible for non-software engineers and build the collaborative features that small businesses and enterprises can benefit from—now with the resources of full-time development talent. With open core, the business model is to <a href="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-01-open-core-standard-pricing-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monetize features based on who will use them</a>, with the core product remaining free and open to all. A strong core is integral to Ondsel’s success, as the core features are often an onramp for casual or hobby users who grow into businesses of their own and require different features as they scale. Having a solid and active open source ecosystem around it is vital to actually democratizing design for everyone.

That was an important milestone … and it passed with hardly anyone noticing. There was another important development last year and it barely got any more attention, even though it was far more consequential.</p><p>I&#x27;m referring to the creation of the FPA: FreeCAD Project Association. The FPA is a legal entity whose mission is to advance and protect the FreeCAD project. Besides being able to receive donations and pay for services, the FPA has a formal membership and decision making structure and this matters.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="freecad-is-changing">FreeCAD is changing<a href="#freecad-is-changing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to FreeCAD is changing" title="Direct link to FreeCAD is changing">​</a></h2><p>For many years the FreeCAD project operated as a loose confederacy of core developers.  Decisions were made by consensus. Development moved forward when someone had an itch to scratch and the project philosophy was, &quot;It&#x27;s done when it&#x27;s done.&quot; That kind of loose government served the project pretty well. Until it didn&#x27;t.</p><p>As the number of developers grew and the codebase got larger, consensus was harder to reach. Some problems defied consensus altogether. Too often, it felt like nobody was steering the ship. Many people wanted to see a clearer roadmap. They wanted leadership to address those thorny issues. Without a roadmap it was too risky for commercial companies to build around FreeCAD. Without leadership, there was no confidence that big problems would be addressed and industrial users were unwilling to adopt FreeCAD for mission-critical use.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introducing-the-fpa">Introducing the FPA<a href="#introducing-the-fpa" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introducing the FPA" title="Direct link to Introducing the FPA">​</a></h2><p>The FPA was launched with modest goals. The founders wanted to avoid a heavy-handed dictatorial style. They want to encourage the kind of collaboration and consensus that has made the project productive and fun for two decades. They also recognized that FreeCAD is maturing as a project and some formal structure is necessary. I was honored to be part of that process and deeply impressed with the wisdom and care that the founders took to balance these interests.</p><p>While the FPA is still finding its footing, it has already started taking steps that should have everyone excited.</p><p>First, the FPA has money and the willingness to fund development. With it, they can encourage focused effort in areas where organic interest hasn&#x27;t emerged.</p><p>Even more importantly, the FPA is working to get developers together in the same room. Zoom, email, and issue trackers are the tools we live with and they work well for day-to-day operations. But there&#x27;s nothing like face-to-face meetings for building trust, resolving conflict, and making long term plans. The ability to work face-to-face is one area where commercial development has a clear advantage over open source software. The FPA recognizes this and is taking steps to change it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="freecad-day-at-fosdem">FreeCAD Day at FOSDEM<a href="#freecad-day-at-fosdem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to FreeCAD Day at FOSDEM" title="Direct link to FreeCAD Day at FOSDEM">​</a></h2><p>The first ever &#x27;<a href="https://blog.freecad.org/2023/01/04/freecad-meeting-day-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCAD Day</a>&#x27; will be held prior to FOSDEM on February 2, 2023.
