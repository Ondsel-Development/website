# About Ondsel

Ondsel is an open-core company built around the venerable FreeCAD Project.

Formed in January of 2023, we're still getting started but we're building on one of the oldest and most successful design tools in the open source world: FreeCAD


## FreeCAD

FreeCAD is a powerful open-source 3D parametric modeling tool. It is multi-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).
It reads and writes many open file formats including STEP, IGES, STL, SVG, DXF and many others.

It provides workbenches for Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Computer Aided Machining (CAM), Architecture, Building Information Modeling (BIM) and 
supports many styles of parametric design.

FreeCAD has a large and active developer base and has been in development for more than twenty years.
