# About Ondsel

Ondsel is an open-core company built around the awesome
[FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) project founded by a long-time FreeCAD 
contributor Brad Collette, maintainer of the Path workbench and author of two
books on FreeCAD. Funding was provided by [Open Core Ventures](https://opencoreventures.com/). We are a 
[public benefit corporation](https://ondsel.com/handbook/About/public_benefit_corp/) â€” 
a company where the usual list of stakeholders expands to include employees,
contributors, and the user community. 

Formed in January of 2023, we're building Ondsel Engineering Suite,
a FOSS 3D CAD program integrated with Lens, our online system for vaulting CAD 
files and product data management.

Ondsel ES ships with built-in tools for constrained sketching and parametric 3D 
modeling, finite element analysis (FEA), and computer-aided machining (CAM).
It supports many open file formats including STEP, IGES, STL, SVG, DXF and many
others. Builds are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
