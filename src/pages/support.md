## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is there a tutorial for using the integrated assembly workbench?**

An introduction to concepts and general workflow is [available in our blog](https://ondsel.com/blog/assembly-wb-prerelease/). You can also watch a recent [extended tutorial by MangoJelly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZYiDnftsns).

**I want to design models for 3D printing. Is there a getting started tutorial for Ondsel ES?**

Most FreeCAD tutorials out there largely apply. For example, you can refer to [this quick tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_o6IzcLHvk) by FreeCAD Academy.

**Is the toponaming issue fixed yet?**

Most of the work on porting toponaming fixes from RealThunder's fork has already been done. However, the port is largely untested, we can't ship it until (vastly) more testing has been carried out.

**Can I run Ondsel Lens on my own server?**

We do not have an on-premise offering yet. It's availability largely depends on market's demand, we are tracking this.
