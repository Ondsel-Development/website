## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I run the build of Ondsel ES for Windows?**

After unpacking the [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) archive, please navigate to the 'bin' folder and double-click 'freecad.exe'. This is a temporary workaround. We will provide an installer soon.

**My operating system complains that your builds are not signed. Are you legit?**

We are in [extended validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate) process, we will sign our builds as soon as we get the token.

**I want to design models for 3D printing. Is there a getting started tutorial for Ondsel ES?**

Most FreeCAD tutorials out there largely apply. For example, you can refer to [this quick tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_o6IzcLHvk) by FreeCAD Academy. 

**Is there a tutorial for using the integrated assembly workbench?**

An introduction to concepts and general workflow is [available in our blog](https://ondsel.com/blog/assembly-wb-prerelease/). You can also watch a recent [extended tutorial by MangoJelly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZYiDnftsns).
